			<p>An NFT, or non-replaceable token, is a type of digital asset that represents uniqueness and cannot be replaced by another token one-for-one. NFT is based on blockchain technology, which ensures that each token is authentic, transparent and cannot be counterfeited. While the concept of NFT can be applied in a variety of fields, the most well-known application is in digital art, collecting, gaming and other forms of digital content.</p>
<h3>Key features of the NFT</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Uniqueness</strong>: Each NFT contains information that makes it different from any other NFT. This uniqueness is confirmed by the blockchain.</li>
<li><strong>Ownership</strong>: Blockchain technology allows for the secure recording of NFT owner information, providing transparency and secure transfer of rights.</li>
<li><strong>Non-interchangeability</strong>: Unlike Bitcoin or traditional money, which are interchangeable and have the same value, each NFT is unique and cannot be exchanged for another NFT on equal terms.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Rarity</strong>: Creators can release a limited number of copies of their work, making them rare and potentially valuable.</li>
</ol>

			<h3>How do NFTs work?</h3>
<p>NFTs are created and managed on blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Flow. When an NFT is created, information about its uniqueness, owner and transaction history is stored on the blockchain. This information is publicly available and can be verified by anyone.</p>
<p>When someone buys an NFT, they acquire the rights to a unique digital object (e.g., digital art, video, music) as well as a record on the blockchain that confirms their ownership. This does not preclude others from copying or viewing the digital object, but only the owner of the NFT has official proof of ownership of the original object.</p>
<h3>Application of NFT</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital Art</strong>: Artists and creators can monetise their work by selling it as NFTs. Buyers, in turn, receive verified ownership rights.</li>
<li><strong>Collecting</strong>: From sports cards to virtual pets, NFTs allow collectors to own unique digital objects.</li>
<li><strong>Games</strong>: In games, NFTs can represent unique items, characters, or even land plots that can be traded on special platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Music &amp; Entertainment</strong>: Musicians and artists can use NFT to sell unique recordings, concert tickets or even exclusive fan experiences. This opens up new opportunities to engage with audiences and monetise content.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Perspectives and challenges of the NFT</h3>
<p>Prospects</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital rarity and copyright</strong>: the NFTs propose a new way to prove authorship and ownership of digital objects that could revolutionise the market for digital content.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Industries Development</strong>: Artists, musicians and other creatives have a new tool to monetise their creations and interact with the public.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problems and criticisms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental issues</strong>: NFT creation and transactions, especially on energy-intensive blockchains like Ethereum, are of concern because of the large power consumption and environmental impact.</li>
<li><strong>Market bubbles</strong>: High demand and speculative interest can create bubbles in the NFT market, making investments risky.</li>
<li><strong>Legal issues</strong>: Issues related to copyright and distribution of copies remain complex and require further development of the legal framework.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>NFTs represent a groundbreaking and exciting step in the evolution of digital content, offering unique opportunities for creators and collectors. However, like any innovative technology, they carry both promise and risk. It is important to approach investments in NFTs with an understanding of both their potential and limitations, and to keep abreast of the ever-evolving legal and environmental standards in this area.</p>
<p>So, NFT is not just a fashion trend, but a significant development in the world of digital assets that could lead to dramatic changes in many areas of culture, arts and entertainment.</p>
<h2>How to create an NFT?</h2>
<p>NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique digital assets that exist on the blockchain and prove ownership of a specific digital object or right. The creation of NFTs opens up new opportunities for artists, musicians, photographers and other creators to monetise their work. In this guide, we will walk through the process of creating an NFT step by step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Selecting a platform for creating an NFT</strong></p>
<p>The first step in creating an NFT is choosing the right platform. There are many platforms such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana and Flow, each with its own features, advantages and disadvantages. Ethereum is one of the most popular platforms for creating NFTs because of its security and wide ecosystem, but transactions on it can be expensive due to high fees.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Creating a digital asset</strong></p>
<p>Before you can turn your creation into an NFT, you need to create the digital object itself. This can be anything: an image, a piece of music, a video file, a text document, and so on. It is important that the object you create is your copyrighted work or that you have the rights to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Selecting a wallet to store the NFT</strong></p>
<p>To create and manage an NFT, it is necessary to have a digital wallet compatible with the chosen blockchain platform. MetaMask is one of the most popular options for Ethereum users. Make sure your wallet is secure and you have a backup copy of your passphrase to restore.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Selecting a Marketplace</strong></p>
<p>To list your NFT for sale or auction, you need to choose a suitable marketplace. OpenSea, Rarible and Mintable are popular platforms that offer intuitive interfaces for creating and selling NFTs. It is important to research the creation and selling fees and available features on different platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Creating and mining an NFT</strong></p>
<p>After selecting a marketplace and uploading your digital asset, you will need to fill in the details of your NFT, including its name, description and properties. Some platforms also allow you to set a royalty so that you can earn a percentage of future resales of your creation. Once these steps are completed, you will be able to &#8220;mine&#8221; your NFT, thereby recording it on the blockchain. This process may require you to pay a transaction fee, the amount of which depends on the blockchain platform you choose and the current network load.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Selling and promoting the NFT</strong></p>
<p>Once your NFT has been created, you can put it up for sale or auction on the selected marketplace. Determine the starting price or minimum bid and specify the duration of the auction, if applicable. Effectively promoting your NFT through social media, blogs or media outlets can significantly increase interest in your creation and, consequently, its value.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: NFT revenue management</strong></p>
<p>Once you have successfully sold your NFT, it is important to manage the proceeds wisely. If you have set up royalties, you will also receive a percentage of each subsequent resale of your NFT. Be aware of the tax liabilities associated with proceeds from the sale of digital assets and consult with qualified professionals to declare them correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for successful NFT creation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authorship and originality</strong>: Make sure your work is unique and original. Using other people&#8217;s work without permission can lead to legal problems.</li>
<li><strong>Market Research</strong>: Understanding current trends in the NFT market can help you better assess the value of your creation and determine the best time to sell it.</li>
<li><strong>Community Engagement</strong>: Active participation in NFT and blockchain communities can increase your project&#8217;s visibility and attract potential buyers.</li>
<li><strong>Concern for the environment</strong>: Given public concern about the environmental impact of blockchain technology, consider using eco-friendly platforms to build NFTs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>NFT creation represents an exciting opportunity for creators to monetise their art and ideas in the digital world. By following this step-by-step guide, you can turn your digital assets into NFTs and start promoting them. Despite all the opportunities, it&#8217;s important to approach the process with an understanding of the risks and be responsible in your choice of platforms and revenue management. Success in the NFT world requires not only creativity, but also strategic planning and promotion.</p>
<h2>How to buy NFT?</h2>
<p>NFTs, or non-replaceable tokens, are unique digital assets that are stored on the blockchain. They can include art, music, videos, and many other forms of digital content. Buying NFTs is becoming increasingly popular as a means of investing, collecting unique digital objects and supporting creators. In this article, we&#8217;ll look at how to buy NFT, from choosing a platform to making a purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Researching platforms to buy NFTs</strong></p>
<p>The first step to buying an NFT is choosing the right platform. There are many marketplaces such as OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation, and others. Each has different features, commissions, and collections available. Do your research to choose a platform that suits your interests and requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Create and set up a digital wallet</strong></p>
<p>To purchase and store NFTs, you will need a digital wallet that is compatible with the blockchain on which the token of interest is issued. The most common are Ethereum-enabled wallets such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet or Coinbase Wallet. Install the wallet, create a new account and make sure you save the secret phrase in a safe place.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Refill your wallet with cryptocurrency</strong></p>
<p>Most NFTs are purchased with cryptocurrency, most commonly Ethereum (ETH). Fund your wallet with ETH or other cryptocurrency you need through an exchanger or cryptocurrency exchange. Keep in mind that blockchain transactions are subject to gas fees, so add a little more money than the value of the desired NFT.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Selecting an NFT to purchase</strong></p>
<p>Explore what&#8217;s available on the NFT Marketplace using filters by category, price and popularity. Pay attention to information about the token, including price history, rarity and number of available copies. It is also important to check the authenticity of the NFT creator to avoid buying fakes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Buying the NFT</strong></p>
<p>When you find the NFT you want, you can make a purchase by following the instructions on the marketplace. Depending on the platform, this may be a direct purchase at a fixed price or participation in an auction. Check all details carefully before confirming your purchase, including the final price including commissions.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Managing your NFT</strong></p>
<p>Once you purchase an NFT, it will be automatically transferred to your digital wallet and displayed in your portfolio on the selected marketplace platform. You are now the official owner of a digital asset that can be sold, exchanged or kept in your collection.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Selling or listing the NFT on the secondary market</strong></p>
<p>If you decide to sell your NFT, most platforms provide an option to easily put it up for sale on the secondary market. You can set a fixed price or choose an auction format. Don&#8217;t forget to take into account the marketplace&#8217;s commission when setting the price of your NFT.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Tax liabilities</strong></p>
<p>It is important to be mindful of the potential tax liabilities associated with buying and selling NFTs. In some jurisdictions, proceeds from the sale of digital assets may be subject to taxation. It is advisable to consult a qualified tax professional for correct declaration of income and payment of taxes.</p>
<h3>Tips for NFT buyers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do your research</strong>: Before buying an NFT, thoroughly research its origin, creator, and sales history. This will help you avoid buying counterfeits and unpopular assets.</li>
<li><strong>Assess the risks</strong>: Like any investment, there are risks involved in buying NFTs. The NFT market can be volatile and asset values can rise or fall.</li>
<li><strong>Consider fees</strong>: NFT transactions incur fees, including Ethereum gas fees and marketplace fees. Make sure you factor these fees into your purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Keep up to date with the news</strong>: The NFT market is constantly evolving, with new projects and opportunities emerging. Follow the latest news and trends to maximise your investment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Buying NFTs opens up access to a world of unique digital assets and provides an opportunity to support creativity and innovation. By following the above steps and tips, you will be able to make considered purchases and manage your NFT collection effectively. Whether you are looking to make a profit or wish to be part of a new era of digital art, it is important to approach the process with care and responsibility.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Buying the NFT</strong></p>
<p>After selecting the NFT you wish to purchase, follow the instructions on the marketplace to complete the purchase. This may include clicking the &#8220;Buy now&#8221; button to purchase immediately at a fixed price or participating in an auction. Make sure you have enough funds to cover the cost of the NFT and the transaction fees (gas fees).</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Putting the NFT up for sale</strong></p>
<p>To sell an NFT, you will need to upload it to your chosen marketplace, specify a price and any additional terms of sale, such as an auction starting price. Most platforms also allow sellers to set a royalty to receive a percentage of future NFT sales.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Promote your NFT</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 7: Monitoring the NFT market</strong></p>
<p>Understanding current NFT market trends can help you better price your asset and choose the best time to buy or sell. Follow news, analysis and sales reports on popular platforms to stay up-to-date on the latest developments and opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Tax Compliance</strong></p>
<p>It is important to consider the tax implications of NFT transactions. Depending on your jurisdiction, proceeds from the sale of NFTs may be subject to taxation. It is recommended that you consult a tax professional to properly declare the proceeds and optimise your tax liabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for a successful NFT sale and purchase</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diversification</strong>: Do not invest all of your funds in one NFT. Diversifying your portfolio can help reduce risk.</li>
<li><strong>Research</strong>: Conduct an in-depth analysis before buying or selling an NFT, including the history of the originator, the uniqueness of the asset and its future potential.</li>
<li><strong>Accounting for fees</strong>: Be aware of transaction and gas fees, as well as marketplace fees, which can have a significant impact on the total cost of transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Be wary of phishing attacks and scams. Use trustworthy platforms and protect your wallets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Buying and selling NFTs is an exciting process that opens up access to new forms of digital art and collecting.

<h2>What is a Non-fungible token?</h2>
<p>A non-fungible token (NFT) is a type of digital asset that uses blockchain technology to prove the uniqueness and ownership of a certain digital object or right. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be split into smaller pieces, each NFT is unique and cannot be exchanged for another NFT on equal terms. This uniqueness makes NFTs particularly attractive for collecting digital art, music, video and other forms of digital content.</p>
<h3>How do NFTs work?</h3>
<p>NFTs are created and managed on a blockchain, typically Ethereum, although other blockchains such as Flow and Tezos also support NFTs. Each NFT contains embedded meta-information, which can indicate the location of a digital object (such as the URL of an image or video) and contain additional information such as authorship, ownership history, and usage rights.</p>
<p>When an NFT is created, data about its uniqueness and owner is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and reliability of ownership information. When an NFT is sold or transferred, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain, updating the ownership record.</p>
<h3>Application of NFT</h3>
<p>NFTs have found applications in a variety of fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital Art</strong>: Artists and galleries use NFT to sell rights to unique digital artworks, often with proof of authenticity and ownership.</li>
<li><strong>Collecting</strong>: From trading cards to virtual real estate in digital worlds, NFTs allow users to collect and trade unique digital objects.</li>
<li><strong>Games</strong>: In video games, NFTs are used to represent unique items, characters, or skills that can be traded outside of the game.</li>
<li>Music <strong>and Entertainment</strong>: Musicians and film producers have started using NFT to sell exclusive content and engage with fans.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advantages and disadvantages of the NFT</h3>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication and ownership</strong>: Blockchain technology enables the authentication of a digital asset and its ownership history to be reliably verified.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Rarity</strong>: Creators can control the number of copies of their works released, creating artificial rarity and increasing the value of assets.</li>
<li><strong>New opportunities for creators</strong>: NFTs provide artists, musicians and other creatives with new ways to monetise their work, allowing them to sell their creations directly to collectors without intermediaries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green issues</strong>: NFT creation and transaction, especially in networks using the Proof of Work consensus mechanism, consumes a large amount of energy, raising concerns about environmental impact.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility</strong>: The NFT market can be extremely volatile, with sharp price fluctuations, making investing in NFTs risky.</li>
<li><strong>Legal and ethical issues</strong>: There are disputes over intellectual property rights, including copyright issues and the possibility of creating and selling NFTs without the consent of the copyright holder of the original work.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The future of the NFT</h3>
<p>Despite current issues and challenges, NFTs continue to attract attention both in the arts and entertainment sector and in broader areas including education, real estate and document management. Technological advancements aimed at reducing blockchain power consumption and improving scalability, as well as the development of new standards and legal frameworks, are expected to drive further growth and integration of NFTs into various aspects of the digital economy.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>NFT have opened a new chapter in the digital world by offering a unique way to represent ownership, authenticity and rarity in the digital space. They have created opportunities for digital content creators around the world to monetise their work directly and on new terms. However, like any pioneering technology, NFTs face a number of challenges, including environmental issues, market volatility and legal uncertainty. As society and technology continue to evolve, NFTs are likely to adapt and change to better meet the needs and values of their users.</p>
<h2>When were the first NFTs created?</h2>
<p>Non-Futurable Tokens (NFTs) have become one of the most talked about topics in the world of digital assets and art in recent years. They are unique digital assets certified on the blockchain, which guarantees their authenticity and uniqueness. The story of NFTs began long before they became widely known and commercially successful. Let&#8217;s explore when the first NFTs were created and what events fuelled their development.</p>
<h3>Early Experiments and Colored Coins</h3>
<p>One of the first experiments preceding the advent of NFTs was the so-called &#8220;Colored Coins&#8221; on the Bitcoin blockchain around 2012-2013. &#8220;Colored Coins&#8221; could be used to represent everything from asset ownership to company shares, and could even be used as a means to create and trade digital collectibles. However, Bitcoin&#8217;s limitations in supporting complex smart contracts and the inability to record additional information about the token led developers to seek other platforms to create unique digital assets.</p>
<h3>The emergence of Ethereum and the first NFTs</h3>
<p>The development of the Ethereum platform, launched in 2015, was a key moment in the history of NFT. Ethereum offered a flexible environment for creating smart contracts and tokens, making it an ideal platform for NFT development.</p>
<p>The first projects that can be considered NFTs in their modern sense were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quantum </strong>(May 2014): Created by artist Kevin McCoy and programmer Anselm Wenger, Quantum is considered one of the first NFTs. This digital art object was sold at the Seven on Seven conference in New York for $4. The Namecoin platform was used to register ownership.</li>
<li><strong>Etheria </strong>(October 2015): Launched shortly after the launch of Ethereum, Etheria was one of the first projects to demonstrate the concept of digital ownership and trading of parcels of virtual land on the blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CryptoPunks </strong>(June 2017): Developed by Larva Labs, the CryptoPunks project introduced a collection of 10,000 unique algorithmically generated characters. Although initially distributed for free, over time some of these digital characters have been sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars.</li>
<li><strong>CryptoKitties </strong>(November 2017): The CryptoKitties game was one of the first viral projects in the NFT world, allowing users to buy, collect, breed and sell virtual kittens. This project not only brought significant attention to NFT, but also revealed the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain, as at peak periods the game noticeably slowed down the network due to the large number of transactions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Development of NFT standards</h3>
<p>With the growing popularity of NFTs, it became apparent that standards were needed for their widespread adoption and interoperability across different platforms and markets. This led to the creation of the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 token standards on the Ethereum platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ERC-721</strong>: Introduced in late 2017, ERC-721 was the first standard for creating non-interchangeable tokens on Ethereum, providing a structure for recording and transferring unique assets.</li>
<li><strong>ERC-1155</strong>: Introduced in 2018, the ERC-1155 standard enabled the creation of both interchangeable and non-interchangeable tokens in a single contract, simplifying and expanding the use of NFTs in games and other applications.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Impact on art and culture</h3>
<p>Over the ensuing years, NFTs have had a significant impact on the world of digital art and culture, allowing artists, musicians and other creatives to monetise their work directly through digital platforms. The sale of NFT artworks for millions of dollars, such as Beeple&#8217;s Everydays: The First 5000 Days, which sold for over $69 million at Christie&#8217;s auction in March 2021, demonstrates the potential of the market and collectors&#8217; interest in digital art.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>The NFT story began with pilot projects and the development of key technology standards that laid the foundation for today&#8217;s ecosystem of non-interchangeable tokens. Since then, NFTs have grown into a significant cultural and economic phenomenon, attracting attention in the fields of art, music, gaming and beyond. While the NFT market continues to evolve, with both ups and downs, its impact on the digital economy and culture will undoubtedly continue to be felt.</p>
<h2>Ways to make money with NFTs</h2>
<p>Non-Futurable Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that are certified on the blockchain, ensuring their authenticity and exclusivity. With the growing popularity of NFTs, they have become not only a means for collecting digital art and other items, but also a powerful tool for making money. In this article, we will look at different ways to make money with NFTs.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Creation and sale of NFT</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The most direct way to make money from NFTs is to create and sell your unique digital assets. Artists, musicians, photographers and other creatives can turn their work into NFTs and put it up for sale on various marketplaces such as OpenSea, Rarible or Foundation.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Collecting and resale</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As with traditional art, you can make money by buying and reselling NFTs. This method requires in-depth knowledge of the market and trends to buy assets at a low price and sell when their value rises.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Acquisition of royalties</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Many NFT platforms allow asset creators to earn royalties on each subsequent resale of their work. This means that you can continue to make money from your NFTs even after the initial sale, receiving a percentage of each transaction.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> NFT Steaking</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Some projects offer the option of NFT &#8220;staking,&#8221; which allows owners to freeze their assets for a certain period of time in exchange for rewards, such as cryptocurrency or other NFTs. This method can offer passive income through your digital assets.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Using NFT in virtual worlds and games</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>NFTs find use in virtual worlds and blockchain games where they can represent ownership of land, buildings, characters or objects. Participation in such games and worlds can offer ways to earn money through trading, renting, or using NFTs to generate in-game profits.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> Creating NFT collections and communities</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Creating an NFT collection that attracts attention and creates a community around it can become a source of revenue through sales, merchandising, sponsorship and events. Successful collections such as CryptoPunks or Bored Ape Yacht Club show how branding and community can add value to NFT.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>The field of NFT offers many opportunities to make money, from creative expression to investing and participating in virtual worlds. However, as with any investment field, it is important to approach NFT with an understanding of the risks and potential changes in asset values. Below are some additional tips and advice for those looking to make money from NFT:</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> Participation in NFT-related DAOs</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) are communities run by their members who can own, create and sell NFTs collectively. Participation in a DAO can offer a return on joint investments in NFTs, as well as the opportunity to influence community projects and decisions.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong> Education and counselling</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As interest in NFTs grows, the demand for educational resources and consulting increases. If you have experience with NFTs, you can offer your services as a consultant or create courses and webinars for those who want to learn more about how to buy, sell or create NFTs.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong> Hosting NFT exhibitions and events</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Organising virtual or physical NFT exhibitions can highlight creators and their work, as well as providing additional income opportunities through ticket sales, sponsorship and on-site sales.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong> Development of NFT integrations and applications</strong></li>

<h2>How to create your own NFT?</h2>
<p>Creating your own non-replaceable token (NFT) has become an affordable way for artists, musicians, writers and any creators of digital content to monetise their works via blockchain technology. NFTs confirm the authenticity, uniqueness and ownership of a digital asset, opening new horizons for digital art and collecting. In this article, we will look at how to create your own NFT step by step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Selecting a platform for creating an NFT</strong></p>
<p>The first step in creating an NFT is to choose a suitable blockchain platform. Ethereum is the most popular platform for NFT because of its widespread adoption and support for the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards, but there are other platforms such as Binance Smart Chain, Flow and Tezos that may offer lower transaction fees.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Create a digital wallet</strong></p>
<p>A digital wallet is required to work with NFTs and the blockchain. The wallet will be used to store your NFTs and cryptocurrencies and to sign transactions on the blockchain. MetaMask is one of the most popular wallets, compatible with many blockchain platforms and NFT marketplaces.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Refill your wallet with cryptocurrency</strong></p>
<p>To create and list an NFT for sale, you will need some cryptocurrency to pay for transaction fees. The amount of cryptocurrency needed will depend on the chosen blockchain platform and the current network load.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Selecting a Marketplace for NFT creation</strong></p>
<p>Choose a marketplace that supports the creation and sale of NFTs on the platform of your choice. OpenSea, Rarible and Mintable are popular marketplaces for Ethereum, while Binance NFT and Hic et Nunc offer support for Binance Smart Chain and Tezos respectively. Some marketplaces require you to create an account and connect your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Creating an NFT</strong></p>
<p>The process of creating an NFT can vary slightly depending on the marketplace you choose, but the general steps usually include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Upload a digital file</strong>: Upload the file you want to turn into an NFT. It can be an image, video, audio file, or any other type of digital content.</li>
<li><strong>Specifying details</strong>: Fill in information about your NFT, including the name, description, and, if provided by the platform, the asset&#8217;s properties or attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Setting royalties</strong>: Some platforms allow you to set royalties so that you receive a percentage of each future resale of your NFT. This creates the potential for passive income each time your NFT is resold in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Price Determination</strong>: You can set a fixed price for your NFT or choose to sell through an auction. Some marketplaces also allow you to set a starting price and minimum bids for auctions.</li>
<li><strong>Listing for sale</strong>: After completing all the required fields and confirming the details, you can list your NFT for sale on the marketplace.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 6: Promoting the NFT</strong></p>
<p>Once your NFT is established and for sale, it is important to actively promote it to attract potential buyers. Use social media, blogs, forums and other platforms to spread the word about your NFT. Communities and groups dedicated to NFT and digital art can be a great place to start.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Monitoring and managing sales</strong></p>
<p>Monitor activity around your NFT and respond to any questions or suggestions from interested buyers. Some marketplaces provide tools and analytics to track views and interest in your NFT.</p>

			<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Starting your own NFT opens up new opportunities for creators to monetise their work and participate in the growing world of digital art and collecting. By following the steps above, you can bring your ideas to life and introduce them to a wider audience in the global NFT marketplace.</p>
<h2>Working principle of the NFT</h2>
<p>An NFT<strong>, </strong>or non-replaceable token, is a unit of account that is used to create a digital cast for a unique item: paintings, photographs, videos, music, gifs. Such items are a great value among collectors, gamers and art lovers. They are bought and sold through auctions.</p>
<p>NFT tokens are stored in a blockchain, a huge chain of blocks, each containing information.</p>
<p>A token is a record in one of the blocks, and, as a rule, there can be a lot of them. But what if you need to create a unique token that has no analogues? The answer is NFT.</p>
<p>NFT token is a unique item transferred from the real world to the virtual world, i.e. to the blockchain. Each of them is unique, inseparable and exists in a single number.</p>
<h3>How files are converted to NFT tokens</h3>
<p>There are a lot of tokenisation platforms. Some of them have a narrow specialisation, such as only game items or art.</p>
<p>The most popular ones are OpenSea, SuperRare, Foundation and Rarible. As a rule, the sites charge a commission in Ethereum cryptocurrency, or ethers, as it is simply called. The size of the commission varies, but it&#8217;s usually a few tens of dollars. The cost is due to the fact that each new token needs to be included in the blockchain.</p>
<p>Usually the commission is charged at the moment of token creation. On some sites, the money is paid immediately after the file is uploaded or after the sale.</p>
<h3>Ways to make money on NFT</h3>
<p>First of all, NFT tokens are an opportunity to earn good money. Authors sell their virtual works to gamers, athletes, collectors, stars, politicians and other wealthy people. The main goal is to monetise the popularity of a particular token.</p>
<h3>Creating your own NFT token</h3>
<p>You can create and publish tokens on OpenSea, Rarible, and SuperRare.</p>
<p>A universal guide for both platforms:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an Ethereum wallet: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet or other. To get started, you will need enough ETH to cover the NFT creation and transfer fees.</li>
<li>Create a digital artwork or collectible in Photoshop, Illustrator or Procreate. Save the file in a compatible PNG, JPEG, GIF format and turn it into an NFT.</li>
<li>Go to one of the platforms and connect your cryptocurrency wallet. Then pay the commission, place the token and wait for sales.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Free token giveaway</h3>
<p>This is another way to make money on the NFT.</p>
<p>Many new platforms entering the crypto market try to lure users with free giveaways of their own tokens.</p>
<p>Usually they are used to pay for goods and services on the site. But there are situations when tokens become a full-fledged cryptocurrency.</p>
<h3>Services for token authors</h3>
<p>Every day millions of people create new NFT tokens to make money from them, but not everyone succeeds. Even if the token is valuable, not every creator knows how to sell it.</p>
<p>Crypto-producers &#8211; people who have a lot of experience selling tokens and working with trading platforms &#8211; help.</p>
<p>If you have such skills, try to promote newcomers. You can find them on thematic forums, trading platforms and social networks.</p>
<h3>Selling tokens to obtain cryptocurrency</h3>
<p>The main feature of this way of investing is that after selling cryptocurrencies, you do not withdraw the money immediately, but buy new electronic currencies with it. Then you wait until the token grows in value to sell it at the maximum value.</p>
<p>The only downside is that the behaviour of cryptocurrencies is sometimes difficult to predict, and you may have to wait a long time before tokens jump in value.</p>
<h3>Copyright and criticism of the NFT</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons for criticising NFT, is the tokens&#8217; rather unclear relationship with copyright. People who buy NFTs often wonder, &#8220;Do I now own the rights to something?&#8221;. No.</p>
<p>NFT does not give any rights to own an item beyond the boundaries of the blockchain platform.</p>
<p>More than 10 years ago, a Nyan Cat video appeared on YouTube. It quickly gained popularity and became a meme. In the video, an animated pixel cat flies across the sky and leaves behind a trail of rainbows. The author of the video, Christopher Torres, sold the NFT-gifku with his brainchild for $580,000 last year.</p>
<p>But there is nothing stopping you from watching the video on YouTube, downloading it or using the cat as a screensaver &#8211; you won&#8217;t face a lawsuit from the token owner.</p>
<p>Another example is Quentin Tarantino&#8217;s film Pulp Fiction. Recently, the director announced that he plans to sell the cut scenes in the form of a token. The person who buys it will receive a unique digital artefact, which he or she can then dispose of as he or she wishes within the platform.</p>
<p>Of course, it has yet to be decided legislatively how tokens relate to copyright, but it&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;ll have to pay the token holder to watch these same scenes online.</p>
<p>Yes, after buying tokens timed to some films or art objects, we can still use them, but that doesn&#8217;t matter. The most valuable thing about the NFT is exclusivity. No one else has the same token as you, and all the information about it is securely recorded in the platform. For collectors, art or gaming enthusiasts, it&#8217;s like buying the original.</p>
<h3>Risks and pitfalls in the NFT</h3>
<p>Investing in NFTs differs little from investing in high-risk assets in terms of danger level. The proof of this was the market crash in 2020-2021 and the slow uncertain recovery that is still ongoing.</p>
<p>The three main risks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>market volatility due to sharp drops and rises in value. Rash investments will bring losses rather than profits;</li>
<li>hacker attacks and fraud, fuelled by the lust to cash in on the very high prices of NFT collections. In May 2022, fraudsters stole 29 Moonbirds NFT tokens worth 750 ETNs;</li>
<li>complexity of studying the sphere &#8211; the indicators forming the value of an NFT-asset are ambiguous and depend on dozens of factors. Choosing the right token to invest in this market is many times more difficult than choosing an instrument on a traditional stock market.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What will happen to the NFT in the future</h3>
<p>Interest in this topic is only growing: platforms are announcing various innovations and attracting investors, while artists and musicians are thinking about how to monetise ideas.</p>
<p>Many questions remain about the rules under which blockchain should play: there are still copyright issues to be resolved and possibly content distribution formats to be reconsidered.</p>
<h2>What is NFT in simple words</h2>
<p>NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique token that represents a digital asset on the blockchain (more on this term below). Simply put, an NFT is proof of ownership of an original digital object, such as an image, video, audio or, for example, a game item. In other words, an NFT can be thought of as a virtual certificate that guarantees its owner the copyright to a specific digital object he or she has created or purchased (yes, NFTs are bought and sold).</p>
<p>Blockchain refers to a distributed database that uses cryptography to ensure the security and integrity of data. A blockchain consists of a set of blocks, each of which contains some information, such as transactions in a cryptocurrency system. Each block contains information about the previous block (hash), which provides a link between the blocks and creates a chain of blocks. This is where the name &#8220;blockchain&#8221; comes from, as the English blockchain means &#8220;chain of blocks&#8221;.</p>
<p>The main advantage of blockchain is that it is a decentralised system, meaning it does not have a single control centre. This means that data is stored and processed on multiple nodes in the network, making it more secure from hacking and fraud. In addition, blockchain reduces transaction processing costs and speeds up the data transfer process, making it attractive for use in a wide variety of technologies.</p>
<h3>Key features of the NFT</h3>
<ul>
<li>Uniqueness. Each NFT is unique and cannot be replaced by another token. This distinguishes NFTs from cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible (or also said to be &#8220;fungible&#8221;) tokens.</li>
<li>Digital Copyrights. NFT allows content creators to take ownership of their works and sell them as unique tokens. The owner of the NFT gets the copyright to a specific object validated by the blockchain. This can be useful for artists, designers, musicians, writers and other creative individuals, as well as collectors.</li>
<li>Storage Reliability. All NFTs are stored on the blockchain, which, as we have shown above, is a decentralised and distributed network. This means that information about the token and its owner is stored securely and is not dependent on any central server or organisation.</li>
<li>Transparency. Thanks to the same blockchain, the ownership history of an NFT, its creation and sale can be easily viewed and verified. This ensures trust between buyers and sellers, and confirms the authenticity of the asset thus registered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong>NFTs have become very popular in recent years and are actively used in various fields, including art, gaming and collecting. And if you want to make money from your art or even turn a hobby into a profession and have an online income, it&#8217;s worth looking into this modern technology. In addition, NFT is evolving rapidly, so its application is likely to expand to other areas as well.</p>
<h2>What are NFTs, and how do they work</h2>
<p>Although the technology at the heart of NFTs has been known for a long time, NFTs became widespread in 2020. Since then, their popularity has continued to grow, especially in the digital arts environment. NFTs have attracted huge interest, but they are often criticised for being volatile, highly speculative and vulnerable to fraudulent schemes. In this article you will find everything you need to know about NFTs.</p>
<h3>Definition of NFT</h3>
<p>NFT is a non-fungible token. Non-fungible token means uniqueness and impossibility to replace one object with another. Unlike NFTs, physical money and cryptocurrencies are interchangeable &#8211; one can be exchanged for the other. Each NFT contains a digital signature that makes the token unique. NFTs are digital assets and can exist in the form of photos, video and audio files, and any other digital format. Here are some examples of NFTs: artwork, comic books, sports-themed collectibles, collectible cards, games, and more.</p>
<h3>How does the NFT work?</h3>
<p>NFT tokens are cryptographic assets on the blockchain (a distributed public registry for recording transactions). Each NFT contains a unique identification code that distinguishes one token from another. This data allows the ownership of the token to be verified and transferred to another owner.</p>
<p>The value of NFTs is determined by the market, i.e. supply and demand, and NFTs can be bought and sold in a manner similar to physical assets. NFTs are digital representations of assets and can be created based on real tangible assets, such as real estate or art. Some users believe that representing real tangible assets as tokens increases the efficiency of buying, selling and exchanging them, and potentially reduces the likelihood of fraud.</p>
<h3>How do I purchase the NFT?</h3>
<p>The NFT market is considered a volatile market with large price swings, making it risky even for experienced investors. If you are thinking about buying NFT, it is important to have a good understanding of the process. Let&#8217;s review the basic steps.</p>
<p><strong>Create an account on a cryptocurrency exchange</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to create an account on a cryptocurrency platform or exchange. A cryptocurrency exchange is an online platform where you can sell and buy different types of cryptocurrencies. To buy NFT, you will need to create an account on the platform of your choice. Different platforms differ in the range of services provided, so it&#8217;s worth researching them and choosing the option that best suits you in terms of functionality, fees and support terms.</p>
<p><strong>Open a cryptocurrency wallet</strong></p>
<p>A cryptocurrency wallet is used to store access keys to your digital assets. The user is given a unique passphrase to gain and regain access to the wallet. It is crucial to ensure that this passphrase is stored securely, as without it you will lose access to your wallet.</p>
<p>Wallets can be hosted on the exchange or operate independently of it. When using an independent wallet, you are responsible for the safety of the wallet and private keys. When a digital wallet is hosted on an exchange, the exchange itself plays the role of an intermediary for cryptocurrency transactions. In this case, the exchange is responsible for the storage of private keys and the security of your assets.</p>
<p>If you want to buy and sell NFT without third-party services, you will need a wallet directly linked to the blockchain. Such a wallet allows you to transfer cryptocurrency directly from one user to another using a public key. There are two ways to store funds: &#8220;hot wallet&#8221; and &#8220;cold wallet&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hot Wallet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software-based wallet or web application</li>
<li>Can be used as a desktop or mobile application, or as a browser extension</li>
<li>Less protected from cyberattacks compared to a cold wallet</li>
</ul>
<p>Cold Wallet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware wallet, physical device not connected to the internet</li>
<li>Considered more reliable</li>
<li>However, such a wallet is easy to lose, also there is no backup recovery option in case the unique phrase is lost</li>
</ul>
<p>It is advisable that the wallet you choose is compatible with the Ethereum blockchain and the blockchain&#8217;s own cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH, Ethereum), as this is the platform on which most NFT trading takes place.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer Ethereum cryptocurrency to a crypto wallet</strong></p>
<p>After selecting an NFT exchange and purchasing ETH cryptocurrency, you need to transfer that cryptocurrency into your wallet. The specific steps will depend on the exchange on which you purchase ETH cryptocurrency, the wallet you use, and the marketplace on which you plan to trade NFT.</p>
<p><strong>Get the NFT</strong></p>
<p>Once you have connected and funded your cryptocurrency wallet, you can start buying NFT. When you purchase an NFT, you acquire ownership of that token. However, the NFT holder has no other rights to the artwork, including rights to modify or reproduce it, unless the transfer of rights has been directly agreed between the buyer and the author of the artwork. Depending on the marketplace, the NFT you purchase may be subject to various restrictions.</p>
<h2>What is an NFT marketplace?</h2>
<p>The NFT marketplace is constantly evolving, but in general, NFT marketplaces typically fall into one of the following three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Marketplace </strong>&#8211; anyone can buy, sell or create NFTs. NFT creation is the unique publication of a token on the blockchain, after which the NFT can be bought and sold. On open marketplaces, the process of creating NFTs is usually done by the marketplace itself, or by the authors of the works.</li>
<li><strong>Closed Marketplace </strong>&#8211; authors of works apply to a marketplace, which usually takes over the creation of the NFT. In this case, there are more restrictions on selling and trading.</li>
<li><strong>Proprietary Marketplace </strong>&#8211; these marketplaces sell NFTs that are protected by trademarks or copyrights of the company that operates the marketplace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some NFT traders create accounts on multiple marketplaces and sign up for alerts so that they don&#8217;t miss new NFT releases. Information about the release of new NFTs is also spread on platforms such as Discord and Twitter, as well as on specialised investment platforms Rarity Sniper and Rarity Tools. When long-awaited NFTs are released, investors tend to act quickly.</p>
<p>Most marketplaces provide users with step-by-step guides on how to use their platforms. After creating an account on a marketplace, you should connect your cryptocurrency wallet to it. Some marketplaces allow you to create a new wallet directly on the marketplace website or use their own proprietary wallets. When using a marketplace&#8217;s proprietary wallet, sometimes discounts or more favourable rates are available compared to using external wallets.</p>
<h3>Examples of NFT marketplaces</h3>
<p>There are dozens of different NFT marketplaces on the market. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>OpenSea</strong></p>
<p>OpenSea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces, offers NFT buyers art, music, fashion, sports, games and collectibles. The marketplace website also offers tutorials for users.</p>
<p><strong>NBA Top Shot</strong></p>
<p>This NFT marketplace for sports fans is designed to trade video clips from basketball games. The NBA Top Shot marketplace has a large number of users and also runs contests and competitions to increase community engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Nifty Gateway</strong></p>
<p>The Nifty Gateway Marketplace offers collections of widely known authors who work in video, multimedia, fine art and animation. This website is designed for buyers who collect art with long-term value.</p>
<p><strong>Rarible</strong></p>
<p>An Ethereum-based platform for creating, buying and selling ownership of digital art objects using NFT.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">NFT scam</h2>
<p>NFT scams are quite common. Here are the most common schemes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phishing </strong>&#8211; fake links and pop-ups advertising new NFT projects and issues on social media.</li>
<li><strong>Catfishing </strong>&#8211; advertising new NFT releases and collections through fake marketplace websites, social media accounts and scammers posing as celebrities.</li>
<li><strong>Fake NFTs </strong>&#8211; scammers sell other authors&#8217; work, passing it off as their own.</li>
<li><strong>Market swing schemes (&#8220;pump and dump&#8221;) </strong>&#8211; fraudsters create a frenzy and artificially increase demand for NFTs to drive up prices, then quickly sell their NFTs, leaving other buyers with assets that have no value.</li>
<li><strong>Promise of no commission for NFT creation </strong>&#8211; scammers resort to methods of pressurising users to take part in a fake promotion that supposedly does not charge a commission for NFT creation. But instead of saving on the fee and receiving the NFT, the victim hands over the rights to manage his cryptocurrency wallet to the scammers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to protect yourself from NFT scams:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Follow common cybersecurity guidelines, such as using strong passwords and two-factor authentication.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s more convenient to store cryptocurrency on exchanges, but it&#8217;s safer to store it in a cold wallet, which is a hardware device where keys and assets are stored offline.</li>
<li>Before investing large sums of money in NFT, do a trial transaction with a small value first to make sure everything works as expected.</li>
<li>Ignore spam, such as private messages or unexpected NFTs from unknown senders &#8211; the latter may contain malicious smart contracts.</li>
<li>Before purchasing NFT, learn about the security measures to protect your data and cryptocurrencies. We recommend studying online guides, reviews and testimonials to assess the risks and understand how the market works.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to avoid becoming a victim of NFT scams?</h2>
<p>In 2021, the NFT market has grown dramatically, with an estimated volume of approximately $22 billion, 280,000 buyers and sellers, and 185,000 unique wallets. However, as the market grows, so do the opportunities for cybercriminals. NFT fraud, NFT art and NFT games are increasingly being reported. This article talks about NFT and how to avoid NFT scams.</p>
<p>NFT is a non-fungible token. In this context, non-fungible means unique, e.g. bitcoins are fungible: one bitcoin can be exchanged for another, they have the same value, but an NFT is not fungible: it is unique and cannot be directly substituted for another NFT. An NFT can be represented in any form: as a photo, video, audio file, and more. The excitement generated by NFTs is also due to their ability to use technology to sell and collect digital art.</p>
<p>In essence, an NFT is a digital asset. It is this aspect that emphasises that an NFT is a token. When you purchase an NFT linked to a digital asset, you do not own the asset itself, nor can you reproduce or use it for commercial purposes. You become the owner of a record of the purchase on the blockchain that you can keep or sell to another person.</p>
<h3>How does the NFT work?</h3>
<p>NFTs are overlaid on top of a blockchain &#8211; a registry of transactions stored across multiple computer systems &#8211; and point to a web link, such as an image file. NFTs are stored primarily on the Ethereum blockchain, although other blockchains also support them.</p>
<p>NFTs are created from digital objects that are both tangible and intangible entities. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objects of art</li>
<li>Gifs and memes</li>
<li>Video</li>
<li>Collectibles</li>
<li>Virtual avatars</li>
<li>Music</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is not a complete list. An NFT can be based on almost any object: Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter, sold an NFT based on his first tweet for more than $2.9 million.</p>
<p>NFTs are the digital equivalent of collectibles: instead of obtaining the artwork itself for display, the buyer acquires a digital file that gives him or her exclusive ownership, as an NFT can only have one owner at a time. The unique data associated with each NFT allows ownership to be confirmed. Owners and creators may also store certain information in the NFT, for example, the NFT metadata for an article may contain the signature of the author or owner.</p>
<p>To collect NFTs, you need a digital wallet that can store both cryptocurrency and NFTs. You also need cryptocurrency to purchase NFTs. There are trading platforms where you can view and transact NFTs. The most well-known ones are OpenSea, Rarible, and Foundation. There is a perception that NFT is a way to support digital art, but on the other hand, any transaction on the blockchain involves resource consumption. When transacting with NFTs, it is important to be aware of the risks involved, including NFT fraud.</p>
<h3>Types of NFT scams</h3>
<p>Both cryptocurrency and NFT are under-regulated areas, and attackers can exploit their vulnerabilities to commit fraud. NFT-related pyramid schemes, OpenSea fraud, NFT financial fraud, and other cases have been in the news. The most famous cases of NFT fraud are described below.</p>
<p><strong>Fake sites</strong></p>
<p>Third-party trading platforms, such as OpenSea, facilitate NFT transactions and secure transactions. However, attackers can create fake trading platforms with similar web addresses to deceive users. The visible components of NFT &#8211; images and text information &#8211; can be easily copied, which means that fake marketplace websites can be made to look very similar to the real thing.</p>
<p><strong>Defrauding investors</strong></p>
<p>Investor fraud is a fraudulent scheme in which aggressive advertising of an asset on social media is carried out, which leads to an increase in the price of the asset. Once the scammers get investors&#8217; money, they stop supporting the asset, which leads to a drop in its value and investor losses. A variation of this theme is when NFT developers block the ability to sell a token: they add code that does not allow the sale, and buyers are left with an unsellable asset.</p>
<p><strong>Market swing schemes (&#8220;pump and dump&#8221;)</strong></p>
<p>Market-shaking schemes involve deliberately buying up NFTs to artificially increase demand. Unsuspecting buyers assume that NFTs have value, join the auction and start bidding. Once the price of the asset rises sufficiently, the fraudsters sell the NFTs at a profit and the buyers receive assets of no value.</p>
<p><strong>Phishing scams</strong></p>
<p>Before purchasing NFT, you must register a crypto wallet. NFT phishing scams usually use fake advertisements, for example, in messengers Discord, Telegram and public forums, which request keys to a personal wallet and a 12-word security phrase. In addition, fraudsters can impersonate MetaMask wallet support and send fake emails warning that the wallet will be blocked due to security issues. Such emails ask you to click on a link to confirm your account. The NFT phishing scam is designed to obtain personal data and steal funds from a digital wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Helpdesk fraud</strong></p>
<p>As in the case of phishing, attackers impersonate technical or customer support staff of blockchain trading platforms and contact unsuspecting users in Telegram or Discord. Under the guise of helping to solve problems, fraudsters send links to fake, but very similar to real sites, in order to obtain personal data and access to cryptocurrency wallets. They may also ask to send a screenshot to solve the problem. What they really want is to get the credentials of the cryptocurrency wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Price fraud</strong></p>
<p>Price fraud can occur when reselling purchased NFTs on the secondary market. Bidders may change the offered selling currency to a cryptocurrency with a lower value without informing the seller, after publishing a bid to sell the NFT. This can lead to potential losses for the seller if they do not double-check the currency before closing the transaction.</p>

<p>Check all the details of the transaction before concluding it. Is the trading platform used reliable and well-known? Can you view the transaction history of the buyer or seller? Read reviews and look at the level of support from the creators of the project, try to find out if there have been previous complaints about transactions with them. When investing in a project, check its developers and make sure they are reliable.</p>
<p><strong>Do not open files from unknown senders</strong></p>
<p>Attackers are developing viruses targeting cryptocurrency wallets. Do not click on links in unsolicited emails - they may lead to fraudulent sites. Do not click on links or open attachments from unknown sources.</p>
<p><strong>Be cautious about participating in raffles</strong></p>
<p>While NFT shenanigans are widespread, they can often involve security risks. Each NFT is tied to a contract that defines what can be done with it. This means that attackers can attach authorisations to NFTs to access the wallet, sell assets and other actions. Never accept NFTs from unknown and untrusted parties.</p>
<p><strong>Tell no one the private key and mnemonic phrase of the cryptocurrency wallet</strong></p>
<p>Keep the private key and mnemonic phrase in a safe place. With this data, an attacker can access the cryptocurrency wallet and delete all NFTs or cryptocurrency from there. Use strong passwords for your cryptocurrency wallet and other NFT accounts. If possible, use two-factor authentication for NFT accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure that the author of the project is reliable</strong></p>
<p>Before transferring funds, find and verify the contact information of the NFT creator you want to purchase from. Make sure that the creators of the project are honest and do not hide their identities. If no information about the persons behind the project can be found, this is a suspicious signal.</p>
<p><strong>Use official websites</strong></p>
<p>Always go directly to verified websites for cryptocurrency transactions, do not use links and pop-ups to enter cryptocurrency wallet keys. Avoid overly attractive transactions - they may lead to dodgy blockchain networks.</p>
<p><strong>Do not visit unreliable sites</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes a small typo in a web address can lead to the wrong site, and in the NFT world, fraudulent sites can be extremely dangerous. Double-check your web address to make sure you're getting to the right site, and never do anything suspicious or inconvenient. Remember, if an offer is so tempting that it looks like a scam, it probably is.</p>
<p><strong>Double-check the price of the NFT project</strong></p>
<p>Before making an NFT purchase, check the price on an official trading platform such as OpenSea or similar. If the price appears to be lower than on a legitimate trading site, be careful - it could be a scam.</p>
<p><strong>Use disposable wallets</strong></p>
<p>A disposable wallet allows you to limit the amount of funds for a particular purchase, including transaction fees. This reduces your exposure to risk in the event of fraud.</p>
<p><strong>Check the data of the author of the project</strong></p>
<p>There is a blue tick next to the names of most legitimate NFT sellers on OpenSea and other marketplaces, and collection properties are also clearly listed. Make sure that the account of the author from whom you are purchasing NFTs is verified and that the author is operating legally. Find him on social media or on his own website. You can ask the author directly if he or she owns the work you want to buy, and correctly</p>

			<p>Offshore jurisdictions are jurisdictions that offer foreign companies and individuals certain tax benefits, enhanced confidentiality and simplified corporate procedures. The term &#8220;offshore&#8221; literally means &#8220;beyond the shore&#8221;, which historically reflected the geographical location of many such jurisdictions located on islands. However, in modern parlance, offshore zones can be located anywhere in the world and do not necessarily have to be associated with maritime or island territories.</p>
<h2>Advantages of offshore jurisdictions</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tax optimisation</strong>: The main advantage of offshore jurisdictions is the ability to reduce the tax burden. Many offshore jurisdictions offer low tax rates or complete exemption from taxes on profits earned outside their borders.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong>: Offshore zones often provide a high level of privacy for business owners and assets, protecting beneficial ownership information and details of financial transactions from public access.</li>
<li><strong>Asset protection</strong>: Offshore companies can offer tools to protect assets from legal harassment, bankruptcy or political risks in the owner&#8217;s country of residence.</li>
<li><strong>Simplification of business procedures</strong>: Many offshore jurisdictions simplify the process of registering and managing companies by minimising bureaucratic requirements and offering flexible corporate structures.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Who are the regulators?</h2>
<p>Each offshore jurisdiction has its own regulatory bodies responsible for the supervision and control of financial transactions and corporate governance. These may be central banks, financial services commissions or specialised regulatory agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Tax rates and requirements for founders</strong></p>
<p>Tax rates and founder requirements vary widely depending on the offshore jurisdiction chosen. While some countries offer full tax exemption for foreign income, others may impose low tax rates or require certain conditions, such as having a local office or director.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical and legal aspects</strong></p>
<p>The use of offshore jurisdictions has been criticised because of the potential for tax evasion and money laundering. International organisations such as the OECD and G20 are working to increase transparency and cooperation between countries to combat financial abuse. It is important to choose an offshore jurisdiction responsibly, taking into account both legal and tax aspects, as well as public perception and ethical standards.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Offshore companies can offer significant advantages for international business, including tax optimisation, asset protection and confidentiality. However, the successful use of offshore structures requires careful planning, knowledge of local laws and compliance with international standards and requirements. It is recommended to seek professional advice to ensure the legality and efficiency of offshore transactions.</p>
<h2>Offshore countries with the most favourable taxation</h2>
<p>The most favourably taxed offshore jurisdictions attract the attention of international investors and entrepreneurs seeking to maximise their tax efficiency and optimise business operations on a global level. Choosing the right offshore jurisdiction requires careful analysis of tax policy, regulatory environment, and the level of privacy and asset protection. In this article, we will look at several offshore jurisdictions that offer particularly attractive tax conditions.<br />

<p>When choosing an offshore jurisdiction, it is important to consider not only the tax rates, but also the reputation of the jurisdiction, the stability of the legal system, the existence of double tax treaties, and the requirements for founders and reporting. In addition, international initiatives to combat money laundering and tax evasion should be taken into account, which may influence the choice of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It is important to seek professional advice to select the most appropriate offshore jurisdiction to meet your business objectives and requirements, and to ensure compliance with all necessary regulatory and tax obligations.</p>
<h2>Who is the regulator in offshore</h2>
<p>Regulators in offshore jurisdictions play a key role in managing and supervising financial activities, setting standards for companies and financial institutions, and ensuring compliance with international standards and regulations. These regulators provide a framework for attracting international business while combating illegal activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing. In this article, we look at who the regulators in offshore jurisdictions are, their roles and functions.</p>
<p><strong>The role of regulators in offshore jurisdictions</strong></p>
<p>Offshore regulators fulfil several key functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Licensing</strong>: Regulators issue licences to companies and financial institutions, allowing them to operate in an offshore jurisdiction.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges and tasks</strong></p>
<p>Regulators in offshore jurisdictions face a number of tasks and challenges, including the need to balance attracting international business with enforcing high standards of transparency and accountability. They must also adapt to ever-changing international standards and pressure from international organisations such as the OECD and FATF.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Regulators play a central role in maintaining the reputation and effectiveness of offshore jurisdictions as trusted centres for international financial and corporate planning. They ensure that offshore zones meet international standards while offering attractive conditions for international investors and companies. The importance of their work in creating a stable and transparent financial environment cannot be underestimated, given the global challenges and demands on the financial industry.</p>
<h2>Offshore taxation</h2>
<p>Taxation in offshore jurisdictions represents a key aspect that attracts international companies and private investors to register their businesses outside their home countries. Offshore zones, due to their unique tax regimes, offer significant advantages over higher tax rates and complex taxation systems in other countries. In this article, we will look at the main aspects of taxation in offshore jurisdictions, including their advantages, types of taxes and major challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages of offshore taxation</strong></p>
<p>The main advantage of registering a company in an offshore zone is the possibility of optimising taxes. This is achieved through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low or no tax rates</strong>: Many offshore jurisdictions offer a zero corporate tax rate for companies that operate outside their jurisdiction.</li>
<li><strong>No tax on dividends, interest and royalties</strong>: This allows companies to reduce their overall tax burden when distributing income to their shareholders.</li>
<li><strong>No capital gains and inheritance taxes</strong>: This helps to protect and grow assets over the long term.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types of offshore taxes</strong></p>
<p>Although offshore jurisdictions are known for low taxes, some of them levy certain types of taxes or fees to support their economies, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Annual government fees</strong>: Regular fees required to maintain the registration of a company.</li>
<li><strong>Licence fees</strong>: For companies engaged in certain activities such as financial services.</li>
<li><strong>Property Taxes</strong>: If a company owns property in an offshore jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges and international requirements</strong></p>
<p>In recent years, the international community has increased demands for transparency and co-operation between offshore jurisdictions to combat tax evasion and money laundering. Initiatives such as the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and the Forum on Global Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes have put pressure on offshore jurisdictions to improve financial reporting and exchange of tax information.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Taxation in offshore jurisdictions continues to attract international business due to their efficiency and opportunities for tax optimisation. However, choosing an offshore jurisdiction requires careful analysis of tax and regulatory requirements, as well as consideration of international standards of transparency and information exchange. It is important to approach offshore planning responsibly, considering both the financial benefits and the potential risks and challenges. Seeking professional advice can help ensure that your company complies with international standards and optimise your tax burden.</p>

			<h2>Offshore company formation with bank account</h2>
<p>Setting up an offshore company with a bank account is a popular strategy for international businesses as it can offer financial advantages such as tax optimisation, improved privacy and simplified business procedures. However, the process requires a thorough understanding of international laws and regulations. Below are the key steps to successfully forming an offshore company and opening a bank account.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Choosing a jurisdiction</strong></p>
<p>The first step in setting up an offshore company is to choose the right jurisdiction. Each offshore jurisdiction has its own unique regulations, tax incentives, and transparency requirements. Some of the popular offshore jurisdictions include Belize, Seychelles, Hong Kong, and Panama. It is important to choose the jurisdiction that best suits your business goals and financial expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Planning the structure of the company</strong></p>
<p>Next, the structure of the company needs to be determined. This includes the number and type of shareholders, directors and beneficial owners. Some jurisdictions require the appointment of local directors or representatives, which may affect your choice.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Company registration</strong></p>
<p>Once the structure of the company has been determined, the process of incorporation follows. This involves filing the necessary documents, such as articles of association and registration forms, with the relevant authorities in the chosen jurisdiction. This process is often assisted by specialised agents or law firms who know the local laws and can ensure that all formalities are complied with.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Opening a bank account</strong></p>
<p>Opening a bank account for an offshore company can be complicated due to international anti-money laundering measures. Banks require various documents such as proof of company registration, details of owners and directors, and a business plan. In some cases, personal presence may be required to complete the account opening process.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Compliance with legal requirements</strong></p>
<p>Once a company has been incorporated and an account opened, it is important to comply with all legal requirements, including filing the necessary returns, paying licence fees and complying with tax obligations. Failure to comply may result in fines and other legal consequences.</p>

			<p>In 2024, value-added tax (VAT) rates in European countries continue to play a key role in tax systems, having a significant impact on the continent&#8217;s economic environment. VAT, as an indirect consumption tax, remains one of the main sources of government revenue in European countries, as well as an important factor in the pricing of goods and services.</p>
<p><strong>General trends</strong></p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a tendency to stabilize VAT rates in most European countries after a series of increases caused by the economic crises of previous years. Nevertheless, individual countries continue to adjust their tax rates in an effort to boost economic growth, increase consumption, or solve government budget problems.</p>
<p><strong>VAT rates by country</strong></p>
<p><strong>Standard VAT rates</strong> in European countries in 2024 range from 17% in Luxembourg to 27% in Hungary, reflecting a significant variety of tax approaches within Europe. Other countries, such as the UK, Germany, France and Italy, keep their rates in the range of 20% to 22%.</p>
<p><strong>Reduced VAT rates </strong>applied to certain goods and services, such as books, medicines, and food, are also widely used to provide social support to the population and stimulate economic sectors. These rates may be significantly lower than the standard rates and vary from country to country.</p>
<p><strong>Features of VAT in different countries</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Germany</strong> keeps its standard VAT rate at 19%, making it one of the lowest among major EU economies.</li>
<li><strong>Hungary</strong> has the highest standard VAT rate in Europe – 27%.</li>
<li><strong>Norway</strong>, which is not a member of the EU, applies a standard VAT rate of 25%, with reduced rates for certain goods and services.</li>
<li><strong>Ireland</strong> offers one of the lowest VAT rates on books and children&#8217;s educational materials, underscoring the country&#8217;s commitment to supporting education and culture.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of VAT on businesses and consumers</strong></p>
<p>VAT rates have a direct impact on the business environment and consumer demand. It is important for companies to understand the structure of VAT in their countries of operation in order to optimize pricing and tax planning. Consumers, in turn, face the impact of VAT on the final prices of goods and services. VAT rates in Europe in 2024 continue to reflect the diversity of economic strategies and social policies of European countries. Understanding these rates is an important aspect for running a successful business and managing your personal finances effectively in the European economy. Below, lawyers and tax consultants from <strong class="golden">Regulated United Europe</strong> have reviewed VAT rates in Europe.</p>

			<p>In 2024, the European Union (EU) tax system continues to exhibit significant diversity, reflecting the unique economic conditions and policy preferences of its members. Despite efforts to harmonise some aspects of taxation, tax rates and approaches to taxation vary widely across the EU.</p>
<h2>Corporate income tax</h2>
<p>EU corporate tax rates in 2024 range from less than 10 per cent in some jurisdictions to more than 30 per cent in others. For example, Ireland maintains one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the EU at 12.5 per cent, which helps to attract international companies. At the same time, France and Germany have some of the highest rates, reflecting their socially oriented approach to fiscal policy.</p>
<h2>Income tax for individuals</h2>
<p>Income tax for individuals also varies widely. Some countries, such as Belgium and Denmark, have high top rates exceeding 50 per cent, while others, such as Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, apply lower rates not exceeding 20 per cent. These differences reflect the diversity of national approaches to spreading the tax burden across different segments of the population.</p>
<h2>Social contributions</h2>
<p>Social contributions that finance social security systems, including pensions, health insurance and unemployment benefits, also vary considerably. In countries such as Sweden and France, total social contributions can be quite high, while in other countries such as Malta and Cyprus they are lower. It is important to note that social contributions may be levied on both employers and employees, depending on the country.</p>
<h2>Value added tax (VAT)</h2>
<p>VAT is an indirect tax that is levied on most goods and services in the EU. Standard VAT rates range from 17 per cent in Luxembourg to 27 per cent in Hungary, although many countries apply reduced rates to certain goods and services such as food, books and medical services. VAT harmonisation within the EU provides common rules for its collection, but leaves room for national differences in rates.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the EU tax system in 2024 remains complex and diverse, reflecting the balance between the pursuit of economic growth, social protection and sustainability of public finances. The diversity of tax systems across the EU emphasises the importance of national sovereignty in tax policy, but also illustrates the complexities faced by companies and individuals operating across borders within the EU. While the EU seeks to harmonise certain aspects of taxation to facilitate trade and investment, national differences remain significant, requiring businesses and investors to plan carefully and consult with experts to optimise tax liabilities. Below, lawyers and tax advisors from <strong class="golden">RegulatedUnitedEurope</strong> provide country-by-country information on European taxation.</p>

<p>Albania&#8217;s tax system in 2024 continues to develop in line with international standards and best practices, aiming to create a favourable environment for business and investment.

<p><strong>Corporate Tax</strong></p>
<p>Corporate tax in Albania remains competitive with other countries in the region and is aimed at encouraging investment in key sectors of the economy.

<p><strong>Value Added Tax (VAT)</strong></p>
<p>VAT is an important source of tax revenue in Albania. The VAT rate is standardised, but a reduced rate can be set for certain goods and services of key importance for the national economy. The VAT refund process for exporters is constantly simplified to stimulate foreign trade activity.</p>
<p><strong>Tax on Income of Individuals</strong></p>
<p>The personal income tax in Albania provides for a progressive taxation scale, providing reduced rates for low-income earners and increased rates for high-income earners. This is aimed at ensuring social justice and income redistribution.</p>
<p><strong>Social Contributions and Real Estate Taxes</strong></p>
<p>Social contributions remain a significant element of the tax system, providing funding for the social protection system. Property and land taxes are also adapted to stimulate the development of the real estate market and optimise the use of land resources.</p>
<p><strong>Digitalisation of Tax Administration</strong></p>
<p>Albania is actively introducing digital technologies into tax administration in an effort to simplify tax planning, declaration and payment. This includes the introduction of electronic declaration and payment systems, as well as improved access to tax information for taxpayers.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Albania&#8217;s tax system in 2024 continues to adapt to global trends and national economic objectives. Improving tax administration, stimulating investment and supporting economic development remain key priorities in the country&#8217;s tax policy.<br />

<img decoding="async" class="alignleft " title="Taxes in Austria 2024 6" src="https://regulatedunitedeurope.com/wp-content/uploads/Flag_of_Austria.svg" alt="Taxes in Austria 2024" width="200" height="auto" /></p>
<h3>Taxes in Austria 2024</h3>
<p>In 2024, Austria&#8217;s tax system includes a number of significant changes and updates to improve tax efficiency and fairness, as well as to stimulate economic growth and innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Changes in the taxation of cryptocurrencies</strong></p>
<p>Austria has made adjustments to the taxation of income from cryptocurrencies such as steaking, airdrops, bounties and hardforks. These gains are now not recognised for tax purposes at the time of receipt, but only upon subsequent sale. In addition, when one cryptocurrency is exchanged for another, the transaction does not result in taxation. A rule has also been introduced that when units of the same cryptocurrency are purchased in succession, a weighted average value in euros is applied to calculate the cost price.</p>
<p><strong>New rules for filing tax returns</strong></p>
<p>An automated quota system for tax consultants has been introduced, according to which tax returns (income tax, corporate tax, VAT and valuation returns) must be filed no later than 31 March of the second calendar year following the reporting period. This innovation is aimed at providing legal certainty and simplifying the process of filing tax returns.</p>
<p><strong>Income tax on profit of legal entities</strong></p>
<p>The corporate tax rate in Austria is 23% from 2024. However, dividends and capital gains paid to an Austrian holding company are exempt from corporate tax if certain conditions are met, such as a direct investment of at least 10% in a foreign company and a minimum holding period of one year.</p>
<p><strong>Taxation of individuals</strong></p>
<p>A progressive tax scale has been introduced for individuals, ranging from 0% for income up to €11,693 and up to 55% for income over €1,000,000. Particular attention is paid to social justice and the promotion of economic participation through various tax incentives, such as a full tax credit for the self-employed of €4,500 per year and the possibility of utilising a 15% income tax credit on investments in certain assets.</p>
<p>These updates reflect Austria&#8217;s commitment to a modern, flexible and fair tax system that can adapt to changing economic conditions and technological progress. They aim to support business development, innovation and fair taxation.</p>
<p><strong>Key aspects of taxation in Austria in 2024:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Changes in Cryptocurrency Taxation</strong>: New rules have been introduced to account for cryptocurrency income in order to simplify and ensure fairness of taxation in this fast-growing field.</li>
<li><strong>New rules for filing tax returns</strong>: Introduction of an automated quota system for tax declarations aimed at simplifying tax administration.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate income tax</strong>: The corporate tax rate is 23 per cent from 2024, with exemptions for dividends and capital gains paid to Austrian holding companies under certain conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Taxation of individuals</strong>: A progressive tax scale for individuals, with tax exemptions and incentives for the self-employed and investments in certain assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes and updates reflect Austria&#8217;s endeavour to ensure efficient and fair taxation while stimulating economic development and innovation. They offer both businesses and individuals benefits through a modern and flexible tax system adapted to current economic and technological conditions.<br />

<h3> Taxes in Belgium 2024</h3>
<p>The Belgian tax system continues to evolve in 2024, including a number of changes and updates to strengthen tax fairness and combat tax evasion. Below are the key aspects of Belgian taxation for 2024 based on available information.</p>
<p><strong>Progressive income tax scale</strong></p>
<p>Belgium applies a progressive income tax scale where the rates increase according to the level of income. For 2024 (for 2023 incomes), the tax rates start at 25% for incomes up to €15,200 and go up to 50% for incomes above €46,440. There is also a tax deduction that allows a portion of income to be excluded from the tax base, reducing the overall tax burden.</p>
<p><strong>Changes in the federal budget and tax measures</strong></p>
<p>As part of the federal budget for 2024, the Belgian government has introduced several important tax measures. In particular, it has decided to temporarily reduce the use of tax assets in the current basket system from 70% to 40% (above the €1 million threshold) until the introduction of the Global Minimum Tax (Pillar 2) system. The interest deduction regime for loans for large companies will also be abolished, leaving it available only to SMEs.</p>
<p><strong>Belgian Cayman Tax tightening</strong></p>
<p>Particular attention is given to tightening the Belgian Cayman tax to further limit the scope for tax evasion through tax havens. In particular, an exit tax is proposed, which would mean that a fictitious dividend from the liquidation of a legal entity is attributed to the founder upon emigration from Belgium. Measures are also proposed to tighten the substance requirements and introduce minimum shareholdings for independent persons in investment institutions and funds to avoid the application of the Cayman tax.</p>
<p><strong>Taxation of non-residents</strong></p>
<p>Belgium also levies tax on non-residents on income derived from Belgian sources. These taxes are based on Belgian source income and may be subject to progressive tax rates similar to those applicable to residents.</p>
<p>These changes emphasise the Belgian government&#8217;s commitment to creating a fairer and more efficient tax system aimed at stimulating economic growth and preventing tax evasion. Important highlights include a progressive income tax scale, temporary tax measures in anticipation of the introduction of the Global Minimum Tax, tax tightening to combat tax havens, and special tax rules for non-residents.<br />

<h3>Taxes in Bosnia and Herzegovina 2024</h3>
<p>In 2024, Bosnia and Herzegovina&#8217;s tax system continues to offer a comprehensive approach to taxation, including both direct and indirect taxes administered at the level of the country and its regions. Based on available information, here are the main aspects of taxation in Bosnia and Herzegovina for 2024:</p>
<p><strong>VAT system</strong></p>
<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina has a unified VAT system that replaces sales taxes at the entity level. The indirect tax authority is responsible for calculating and collecting VAT. The VAT rate is 17 per cent and it applies to most goods and services. The VAT paid by companies on their purchases is deducted from the VAT charged on the provision of goods and services, so that companies only pay the difference between the VAT collected and the VAT paid. Final consumers in the supply chain bear the full cost of VAT.</p>
<p><strong>Main provisions</strong></p>
<p>Most goods and services are subject to VAT, but there are exemptions and special schemes for small companies, farmers, travel agencies, suppliers of second-hand goods, art and antiques, and goods sold at public auctions. Some activities are exempt from VAT, including postal services, medical and educational services, social welfare and sports services, and financial and money services.<br />

<h3>Taxes in Bulgaria 2024</h3>
<p>In 2024, Bulgaria&#8217;s tax system continues to offer a stable and attractive environment for both businesses and individuals, emphasising the structure of flat tax rates for different types of taxes. Below is a detailed overview based on the latest legislative updates and policy decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate income tax</strong></p>
<p>Bulgaria has introduced significant changes to the Corporate Income Tax Act, establishing a minimum effective tax rate of 15 per cent for large Bulgarian groups and Bulgarian members of foreign large corporate groups. This change, effective from 1 January 2024, is in line with the European Union directive on guaranteeing a global minimum tax level for multinational enterprises and large-scale national groups. The directive targets entities in Bulgaria that are members of MNE groups or large-scale national groups with annual revenues exceeding EUR 750 million in the consolidated financial statements of the parent company for at least two of the four financial years immediately preceding the current financial year. This measure aims to address taxation where the effective tax rate is below 15%.</p>
<p><strong>Personal income tax</strong></p>
<p>Bulgaria maintains a flat tax rate of 10% on personal income, including various types of income such as income from employment, business activities and other sources. The system allows a number of tax exemptions and deductions aimed at supporting persons with disabilities, personal contributions to voluntary social security and insurance, pension insurance, donations, young families, children and non-cash payments.</p>
<p><strong>Social insurance and health insurance</strong></p>
<p>Bulgaria&#8217;s tax system also includes comprehensive social security and health insurance contributions, with rates and obligations specified for both employers and employees. These contributions cover a wide range of social and health benefits, providing a safety net for the working population.</p>
<p><strong>VAT system</strong></p>
<p>The standard VAT rate in Bulgaria remains at 20% for most goods and services. Special VAT schemes and reduced rates apply to certain goods and services, including a reduced rate for tourism-related activities. The VAT system is designed so that it is not a cost to businesses as they can deduct the VAT paid on their purchases from the VAT charged on supplies. End consumers in the supply chain bear the full cost of VAT. In addition, recent amendments have been made to tax laws, including aspects related to electricity contributions, VAT and corporate income tax, ensuring that the system adapts to both local and global economic conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Local taxes and levies</strong></p>
<p>Local taxes and fees in Bulgaria, such as property tax and vehicle tax, are determined by municipal councils and may vary by location. The system offers flexibility and autonomy at the local government level to address specific municipal needs and priorities.</p>
<p>Bulgaria&#8217;s tax regime in 2024 continues to be characterised by its simplicity, competitive rates and compliance with international standards. The introduction of a 15% corporate tax for large groups is a significant step towards global tax reform efforts, while the flat income tax rate and VAT system provide clarity and predictability for taxpayers. For businesses and individuals, Bulgaria offers a tax environment conducive to economic activity and investment, balancing the promotion of growth and fair taxation.<br />

<p><strong>Income tax for individuals</strong></p>

<h3> Taxes in Switzerland 2024</h3>
<p>In 2024, the Swiss tax system continues to demonstrate its uniqueness due to the country&#8217;s decentralised structure, where taxes are levied at the federal, cantonal and communal levels. This creates a complex and tiered tax system for both individuals and businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate income tax</strong></p>
<p>At the federal level, corporate income tax (CIT) is levied at a flat rate of 8.5% on after-tax profits, resulting in a pre-tax income tax rate of approximately 7.83%. In addition to the federal CIT, each canton sets its own income and capital tax rates for companies at the cantonal and communal levels. The overall range of maximum CIT rates on pre-tax income at the federal, cantonal and communal levels varies from 11.9% to 21.0%, depending on the location of the company in a particular canton.</p>
<p><strong>Income tax for individuals</strong></p>
<p>Personal income tax in Switzerland is levied at both federal and cantonal level, subject to a variety of allowable deductions. The Swiss tax system provides for different rates and deductions for single taxpayers and families with children, as well as opportunities to reduce the tax burden through various allowable expenses such as commuting, workplace meals, alimony, charitable contributions, daycare and medical expenses. Switzerland also has bilateral tax treaties with more than 80 countries to avoid double taxation.</p>
<p><strong>VAT</strong></p>
<p>As of 1 January 2024, new VAT rates have been introduced in Switzerland: the standard rate has been increased to 8.1%, the reduced rate to 2.6%, and the special rate for the accommodation sector to 3.8%. This change was adopted to finance old-age and survivors insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Social contributions and additional taxes</strong></p>
<p>The Swiss tax system also includes property and wealth taxes, including property tax and income tax on the deemed rental value of real estate. Property tax rates vary by canton and generally range from 0.2% to 0.3% of the assessed value of the property. In addition, persons owning real estate or other assets in Switzerland may be liable to pay a wealth tax calculated on the basis of net wealth, subject to the deductibility of provable debts.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Switzerland&#8217;s tax system in 2024 continues to balance the need to fund public and cantonal services with the desire to maintain the country&#8217;s competitiveness as an attractive place to do business. Due to its tiered tax structure, the tax burden can vary significantly depending on the location of a company or home, highlighting the importance of careful planning and consultation with tax professionals to optimise tax liabilities.</p>

These rates can vary widely from country to country and depend on many factors, including income, type of employment, and even the individual characteristics of the employee or employer.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic stands out among EU countries due to its tax policy, offering self-employed EU citizens the benefit of a flat tax rate of 15%, which can be further reduced by applying a lump-sum tax deduction, resulting in an effective tax rate of 6-9% for self-employed entrepreneurs. This makes the Czech Republic attractive for self-employed EU citizens.</p>
<p>Georgia, although not a member of the European Union, is noteworthy for its territorial taxation system, where income earned outside the country is in most cases not taxed. Individuals with annual income up to 500,000 Georgian lari (approximately USD 194,000) are subject to a 1% tax rate.</p>
<p>Also, among the countries with interesting tax policies, Malta stands out, offering foreign nationals the option of paying an annual flat fee and exempting them from taxation on foreign income that is not remitted to Malta. This may make Malta an attractive choice for those looking for a country with low social contributions and income taxes.</p>

These countries apply a flat tax system, which makes them attractive to international entrepreneurs and individuals looking for low-tax countries.</p>
<p>These data highlight the diversity of tax systems in Europe and can serve as important information for individuals considering relocating or investing in different European countries. It is important to consider not only income tax rates, but also other tax liabilities and the overall tax and legal environment in the country.</p>

These countries apply progressive tax systems, where the tax rate increases with the taxpayer's income. Rates may vary depending on different income thresholds and applicable deductions.</p>
<p>Denmark stands out among European countries for having the highest top income tax rate, emphasising the country's commitment to social equality and financing an extensive social security system through tax collections.</p>
<p>France and Austria also show high income tax rates, reflecting their approach to social security and income distribution. These countries make efforts to provide social protection to citizens through the taxation system.</p>

According to data published on Wikipedia, the minimum wage in Kosovo is 170 euros for workers under 65 and 130 euros for young people under 35. These figures reflect the low level of income in the country compared to other European states.</p>
<p>In 2024, the lowest average wages in the European Union, according to available data, are in Bulgaria. Statistics from Eurostat indicate that Bulgaria is in the group of countries with a national minimum wage below PPS (purchasing power standard) 1000, reflecting the low level of wages in the country compared to other EU members</p>
<p>This information highlights the large differences in wage levels between countries in Europe, with some countries such as Luxembourg, Denmark and Switzerland having significantly higher average wages. The gap in living standards and incomes between the eastern and western parts of Europe remains marked, with individual countries seeking to raise minimum wages and improve the living conditions of their citizens.</p>

This follows from the general context, where Luxembourg is often mentioned in various sources as a country with high wages supported by a strong financial sector and high living standards.</p>
<p>In addition, in the context of Europe as a whole, countries like Switzerland and Iceland also stand out with high wages due to their developed economies, high living standards and labour market specifics. However, it should be taken into account that high wages in these countries are also accompanied by a high standard of living and taxation, which may affect the real purchasing power of the population.</p>

<p>Decoding Financial Evolution: EMIs vs. Traditional Banks</p>
<p>The past five years have witnessed the rapid expansion of the financial services industry, notably in the realm of Financial Technology (FinTech). Among the prevalent FinTech services, Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) have emerged as prominent players challenging the traditional banking landscape. This discussion aims to elucidate the distinctions between EMIs and conventional banks, shedding light on the pros and cons associated with each.</p>
<p>EMIs Unveiled: The Rise of FinTech Pioneers</p>
<p>Electronic Money Institutions function as enterprises providing financial services, including the issuance of electronic currency and facilitating digital payments. Unlike traditional banks, EMIs operate in the digital realm, leveraging technology to streamline financial transactions. EMIs offer agility, quick transactions, and lower operational costs, making them attractive to businesses and individuals seeking efficient financial solutions.</p>
<p>Traditional Banks: The Conventional Pillars of Finance</p>
<p>Traditional banks, with their established brick-and-mortar presence, have long been the backbone of the financial sector. Known for stability and a wide range of services, they offer a sense of security but often come with slower processes, higher fees, and complex regulatory compliance. Traditional banks have the advantage of physical branches, providing face-to-face interactions for certain services.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Pros and Cons: EMIs vs. Traditional Banks</h2>
<p><strong>EMIs:</strong></p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agility and efficiency in digital transactions.</li>
<li>Lower operational costs, leading to potential cost savings for users.</li>
<li>Accessibility and convenience, especially for online businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited physical presence may raise concerns about trust and reliability.</li>
<li>Stricter regulatory scrutiny due to the relatively new nature of the industry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Traditional Banks:</strong></p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Established trust and reliability with a long history in the financial sector.</li>
<li>Physical branches for face-to-face interactions.</li>
<li>Diverse financial services, including investment and mortgage products.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slower processes and higher fees for certain transactions.</li>
<li>Limited agility compared to digital-native EMIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rise of EMIs in the FinTech landscape challenges the conventional dominance of traditional banks. EMIs offer speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, particularly in the digital realm. Traditional banks, while offering stability and a broad range of services, face the challenge of adapting to the evolving preferences of a digitally-driven generation. The choice between EMIs and traditional banks depends on individual needs, preferences, and the specific requirements of businesses or individuals. As the financial landscape continues to evolve, both EMIs and traditional banks play crucial roles, offering diverse options to meet the varied needs of consumers and businesses alike.</p>
<p>An Electronic Money Institution (EMI) operates as a financial entity authorized to issue electronic money (e-money), a digital payment system facilitating electronic transactions for individuals and businesses. E-money is stored in electronic wallets or on prepaid cards, enabling online and in-person purchases where e-money is accepted. Regulated by financial authorities, EMIs are mandated to maintain a specified capital reserve to ensure the stability of the e-money system.</p>
<p>Banks, in contrast, are traditional financial institutions offering a wide array of financial products and services, including checking and savings accounts, loans, credit cards, and investment products. Governed by national or federal authorities, banks are subject to capital requirements for stability. Some banks also provide electronic payment services, akin to those offered by EMIs, in addition to issuing traditional currency.</p>
<p>Opening an account online with an Electronic Money Institution involves meeting specific criteria, varying based on the institution and jurisdiction. Typically, you&#8217;ll need to present government-issued identification, such as a driver&#8217;s license or passport, along with proof of address, like a utility bill. Additional information or verification may be required based on the country&#8217;s laws and the specific EMI&#8217;s policies.</p>
<ul>
<li>KYC (Know Your Customer) Rules: Ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulations, EMIs verify client identities.</li>
<li>Compliance: EMIs adhere to legal parameters set by the nation in which they operate.</li>
<li>Risk Management: Gathering and validating specific information helps EMIs accurately identify and manage customer-related risks.</li>
<li>Minimum Deposit: Some EMIs may require a minimum deposit to ensure the account remains active and compliant with regulatory authorities.</li>
<li>Proof of Address: EMIs may request proof of address to confirm residency and facilitate mail correspondence.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s essential to note that requirements can vary by EMI and country, so it&#8217;s advisable to inquire directly with the specific EMI for their detailed specifications.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Advantages of digital banks<strong> </strong></h2>
<p>In the contemporary era, banking online has become exceptionally straightforward. Most banks are rapidly enhancing their online services and applications, making online banking easier than ever before. If you&#8217;ve ever pondered, &#8220;Is online banking easy?&#8221; the answer is a resounding yes! Online banking seamlessly combines the familiarity of your local branch with cutting-edge technology, all available at your fingertips. Transitioning to online banking not only simplifies the way you handle your finances but also provides you with complete control to tailor your banking experience according to your preferences, ultimately saving you both time and money. Delve into the advantages of online banking to discover how empowering it is to directly manage your finances.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile apps:</strong></p>
<p>The traditional confines of banking within the 9-to-5, Monday through Friday schedule are a thing of the past. Online banking offers unparalleled convenience, especially with the user-friendly mobile apps provided by financial institutions. Take, for example, the Discover® mobile app, where you can effortlessly deposit checks, settle bills, transfer funds, and check your account balance, all at your convenience.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service:</strong></p>
<p>While it might be assumed that online banks lack robust customer service, in reality, it stands as one of the primary advantages of these institutions. Online banking doesn&#8217;t imply a loss of access to personalized assistance. Whether you prefer calling, engaging in online chats, or sending emails, avenues for customer support abound. Discover, for instance, extends 24/7 customer service, ensuring you have multiple communication channels available when you need assistance—all without stepping outside your home.</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong></p>
<p>Security assumes a paramount role in the realm of online banking. Security features for online savings or checking accounts often involve password protection and additional identity confirmations. Encryption technology adds an extra layer to prevent unauthorized access to your personal data. Managing your account online allows you to monitor activities at your convenience, promptly detecting any suspicious behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Rates:</strong></p>
<p>Another standout advantage of online banking is the provision of superior rates. Online banks can often offer higher rates due to significantly lower overhead expenses, enabling them to pass on these savings to their customers. This stands out as a major benefit for both online savings and checking accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Environment</strong>:</p>
<p>Embracing online banking contributes to a reduction in your carbon footprint. Opting for paperless statements, conducting money transfers, and paying bills online are eco-friendly practices that online banking facilitates. By minimizing visits to physical bank locations, you not only save time and gas but also play a part in protecting the environment.</p>
<p>In recent years, the banking industry has undergone a profound transformation, driven by a surge in demand for user-friendly online services. This shift has paved the way for unexpected collaborations between traditional banks and fintech companies, overcoming historical distrust and market competition. As both sectors adapt to meet the ever-changing needs of customers, fruitful partnerships are emerging, ushering in a new era of customer-centric, digital banking experiences.</p>
<p><strong>The Rise of Digital Banking:</strong></p>
<p>The prevalence of digital banking through mobile devices has become a driving force behind the industry&#8217;s evolution. Recognizing the imperative to offer mobile-friendly financial services, banks are embracing innovations like cloud technology. This enables customers to access real-time banking data and conduct transactions virtually anywhere, emphasizing the need for robust online security measures to protect against evolving cyber threats.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Collaboration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The collaboration between traditional banks and fintech companies yields a multitude of benefits:</li>
<li>Technological Expertise: Fintech start-ups bring valuable technological expertise that enhances the user experience of online financial services. Their deep understanding of seamless online client experiences contributes to the evolution of digital banking.</li>
<li>Enhanced Reputation: Collaborative efforts enhance the standing of both parties among their customers. This shared commitment to customer welfare fosters trust, boosting brand recognition and credibility.</li>
<li>Increased Scalability: Collaborations allow for increased scalability that might not be achievable individually. Joint projects can be expanded and adjusted to meet evolving customer demands, showcasing adaptability in response to changing needs.</li>
<li>Consumer Targeting Strategies: Collaborations often involve an exchange in consumer targeting strategies. Both parties gain access to each other&#8217;s customer base, broadening their target markets and reaching untapped consumer segments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Partnerships: A Catalyst for Industry Evolution:</strong></p>
<p>Partnerships between banks and fintech companies are integral for the future of both industries. The ongoing shifts in consumer behavior, driven by advancing technologies, necessitate a combined approach to capitalize on the growing trust customers place in digital financial services. Nelito Systems stands as a prime example, showcasing the potential of such collaborations in finance and other sectors through its tailored solutions.</p>
<p><strong>The Fintech Revolution:</strong></p>
<p>Fintech has revolutionized the financial landscape by transitioning transactions and operations into the online realm. The advent of online payments has propelled businesses forward, leveraging fintech apps that incorporate cutting-edge technologies such as AI and data science. These user-friendly apps offer a superior customer experience, contributing to the substantial annual revenues of the fintech industry, projected to double by 2030, with an estimated peak investment of $91.5 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Cost-Effective Fintech App Development:</strong></p>
<p>Fintech app development stands out for its cost-effectiveness, driven by code reusability across various applications. This results in reduced time and expenses, enabling developers to focus on other crucial aspects of application development. Automation in operations, particularly in areas like credit risk, minimizes human intervention, leading to cost savings in client servicing.</p>
<p>The evolving landscape of banking is marked by collaborative efforts between traditional banks and fintech companies, ushering in a customer-centric digital era. As the industry continues to embrace technological advancements, partnerships will be crucial for staying ahead of consumer demands and capitalizing on the growing trust in digital financial services. The symbiotic relationship between traditional banks and fintech is shaping the future of finance, offering customers innovative, secure, and efficient solutions.</p>
<p>Fintech apps have emerged as a driving force, reshaping the financial landscape and fostering financial inclusion. Their impact extends beyond mere convenience, significantly enhancing the consumer experience through exceptional financial services. This blog explores the multifaceted role of fintech apps in providing improved access to banking services, facilitating savings, and delivering an overall superior financial experience.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing Financial Inclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Fintech apps are pivotal in fostering financial inclusion by breaking down barriers and providing unparalleled financial services. They contribute to improved access to banking services, facilitate savings, enhance convenience, and ultimately offer a superior financial experience.</p>
<p><strong>The Convenience Paradigm:</strong></p>
<p>Fintech apps epitomize convenience by leveraging mobile connectivity, thereby enhancing efficiency. This results in an improved user experience, increased access to information, and enhanced transparency in business operations. Notably, fintech has successfully extended financial services to individuals without bank accounts, ensuring inclusivity and bridging gaps in traditional banking.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency in Funding:</strong></p>
<p>Fintech facilitates same-day loan funding for both businesses and personal needs through various online lenders. The efficiency and speed of fintech services, coupled with customizable apps, simplify complex business activities. Start-ups can utilize fintech software to raise funds and explore diverse funding options, fostering financial growth and innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Streamlining Financial Processes:</strong></p>
<p>Fintech excels in streamlining financial processes, addressing traditionally mismanaged areas in business. Digital banking platforms simplify bookkeeping, automate critical financial operations, provide real-time transaction visibility, and enable instant payment transfers. Controlled access features enhance security by assigning limited privileges to specific accounts, ensuring the integrity of financial transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Management and Security:</strong></p>
<p>Fintech plays a crucial role in risk management by leveraging analytics capabilities through automation, machine learning, and big data. Real-time transaction monitoring effectively counters money laundering and illegal activities. Features like Know Your Customer (KYC) on e-commerce apps reduce purchase friction and improve customer experience by mitigating non-payment risks, ensuring a secure financial environment.</p>
<p><strong>Integration for Growth:</strong></p>
<p>Integrating fintech products enhances the proficiency and growth of organizations, offering cost-effective solutions to improve customer experience. Speed, convenience, and personalization, facilitated by Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, contribute to customer retention and satisfaction. Fintech serves as a catalyst for business evolution by aligning technological advancements with financial needs.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation and Transformation:</strong></p>
<p>Fintech brands and apps, driven by innovative approaches and futuristic technologies like AI, AR, and IoT, have transformed the business landscape. E-wallet applications, preferred for their ease of use, exemplify the innovative nature of fintech. Transparency, facilitated by big data and open banking, instills trust in consumers and fosters their loyalty, heralding a new era in financial transactions.</p>
<p>In essence, fintech apps represent a transformative force in the financial world, offering a seamless, innovative, and transparent experience for both businesses and consumers alike. As the fintech landscape continues to evolve, these apps are poised to play an increasingly pivotal role in shaping the future of finance, making financial services more accessible, efficient, and inclusive than ever before.</p>
<p>The global shift toward digital banking is undeniable, fueled by the undeniable convenience and user-friendly features it offers. However, amidst the efficiency of digital transactions, customers express a longing for human interaction, especially in complex financial matters. Striking the right balance between the efficiency of digital banking and the personal touch of human assistance has become imperative. This delicate fusion of convenience and personalized service is precisely what Avanade terms as Human-Centered Digital Banking.</p>
<p><strong>The Revolutionary Role of Generative AI:</strong></p>
<p>In this transformative landscape, one technology stands out as the linchpin for reintroducing humanity into banking processes – Generative AI. Powering tools like ChatGPT-4, this influential technology not only seamlessly blends digital convenience with a human touch but also enhances the operational efficiency of financial institutions, making their backend processes more cost-effective than ever.</p>
<p><strong>Transformative Shift in Bank-Customer Relationships:</strong></p>
<p>Our team, deeply engaged with professionals in the field, witnesses a revolutionary shift in how banks perceive their customers. The focus has shifted to expanding the share of the customer&#8217;s wallet while simultaneously creating a seamless experience across various channels.</p>
<p><strong>The Human-Centered Approach:</strong></p>
<p>Modern human-centered digital banking leverages a secure end-to-end, full-service virtual collaboration platform infused with elements of generative AI to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tailor a customer&#8217;s digital experience based on their unique needs and preferences.</li>
<li>Execute assigned tasks efficiently, freeing up personnel to provide quicker and easier value unlocking assistance to customers.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach ensures that technology enhances rather than burdens interactions, with Generative AI serving as the platform&#8217;s co-pilot.</p>
<p><strong>A Real-World Scenario:</strong></p>
<p>Consider a scenario where a customer, Jane, schedules a live meeting with her financial advisor, uploads updated financial statements in real-time, and receives assistance from an AI co-pilot. Simultaneously, the financial advisor, Jeremy, efficiently navigates a comprehensive dashboard, optimizing his time and providing Jane with customized advice. This seamless integration is not just an ideal scenario; it is actively being deployed by financial services organizations today.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing Customer Experience Amidst Rising Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>In an era defined by groundbreaking technologies, the prospect of having the convenience of digital banking alongside the option to engage with an actual human is a reassuring prospect for consumers. As banks navigate challenges like diminishing loan demands and rising interest rates, prioritizing customer experience emerges as the linchpin for attracting, retaining, and engaging customers.</p>
<p><strong>The Rise of Neobanks and Customer Expectations:</strong></p>
<p>Neobanks, with their focus on robust customer journeys, have set the bar high, intensifying customer expectations. Traditional banks are now racing to catch up, emphasizing the importance of enhancing customer experiences in the digital age.</p>
<p><strong>Adapting to Cashless Trends and Super Apps:</strong></p>
<p>The evolving banking preferences of Australian customers underscore the diminishing use of cash and the increasing preference for cashless transactions. The rise of &#8220;super apps&#8221; introduces integrated financial service options, transforming the landscape of digital engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Embracing the Human Touch in Digital Evolution:</strong></p>
<p>Consumer behavior and expectations have undergone significant shifts, with a heightened desire for personalized access to experts and acknowledgment of pivotal moments in daily life. While digital engagement has surged, the human touch remains invaluable.</p>
<p>In navigating the future of banking, the fusion of digital efficiency and human-centered services facilitated by generative AI emerges as the path forward. As customer expectations evolve, financial institutions must embrace innovative technologies to deliver seamless experiences that prioritize both convenience and the human touch. The journey towards Human-Centered Digital Banking is not just a vision; it is the reality shaping the future of financial interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy Infrastructure Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>Forrester&#8217;s 2022 Australia Customer Experience Index underscores the superiority of experiences delivered through a blend of digital and physical channels in terms of quality and brand loyalty. Similarly, Gartner&#8217;s study reveals that customers utilizing a hybrid of digital and human channels exhibit higher revenue potential compared to those relying solely on digital channels.</p>
<p>Legacy infrastructure remains a hindrance for traditional banks, preventing them from meeting evolving customer expectations. The surge in digital payments places additional strain on outdated infrastructure, impacting overall resilience and rendering banks more susceptible to cybersecurity threats. Disruptors, unencumbered by legacy systems, offer faster and more convenient payment services, bolstering security and providing transparency into personal finances.</p>
<p>Despite the existence of digital solutions like the cloud, traditional financial institutions grapple with optimizing these technologies for enhanced efficiency and agility. An integrated and cohesive cloud platform can serve as a crucial foundation for building a tech ecosystem, creating a multiplier effect that delivers enhanced experiences and new products for customers.</p>
<p>Super apps and social networking platforms are poised to disrupt established banking norms. In the coming years, major banks must seize these opportunities, aligning with the rules of the digital era. By understanding evolving customer segments, meeting expectations, and swiftly delivering capabilities, banks can maintain leadership through trust, offerings, and experiences in 2023 and beyond.</p>
<p>In the face of today&#8217;s uncertainties, customers are increasingly seeking more than just transactional services from their banks; they are yearning for support, empathy, and a personalized touch. However, the underutilization of personal information by banks, when compared to other digital services, poses a perplexing challenge. While banks have embraced digital evolution to streamline processes and reduce costs, this has inadvertently led to emotionally sterile transactions, severing the once-strong customer connection. This blog post explores the imperative for traditional banks to strike a delicate balance between human interaction and digital transactions in order to meet evolving customer expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Fintechs Leading the Way:</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Fintechs, with their simpler portfolios and cloud-native approach, have excelled in providing enhanced customer experiences. In contrast, traditional banks, burdened with complex portfolios and systems, face limitations, particularly among frontline staff. However, there is untapped potential in unleashing the expertise of bank employees, coupled with collaboration tools, to bridge the growing human-digital gap and unlock significant opportunities for customer engagement.</p>
<p>The Power of Hybrid Experiences:</p>
<p>Gartner&#8217;s findings underscore the revenue potential of customers engaging through a blend of digital and human channels, surpassing those relying solely on digital interactions. Despite the surge in digital engagement, customer preferences lean towards a hybrid experience, as highlighted by Accenture&#8217;s research. Digital alone, it seems, does not suffice in differentiating a bank or fostering authentic relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for a Holistic Approach:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Contextual Conversations: Surprise customers by showcasing knowledge gained from their interactions, prompting more focused and intelligent queries.</li>
<li>Meeting Customers Where They Are: Understand customers&#8217; unique situations, demonstrating empathy and recognition of their challenges or aspirations.</li>
<li>Predicting Customer Intent: Leverage customer insights and data to anticipate future needs and align services accordingly.</li>
<li>Personalized Experiences: Utilize customer-provided data to tailor conversations, fostering confidence and trust.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Microsoft&#8217;s Transformative Approach:</strong></p>
<p>A proposed paradigm shift envisions an operating model where everyone servicing customers becomes customer-facing. The effective use of AI and collaboration tools can empower associates, creating loyalty and growth. Microsoft, through integration with platforms like Microsoft Teams, is at the forefront of this transformative approach. A North American bank case study illustrates the development of a secure, personalized approach leveraging Microsoft&#8217;s Cloud for Financial Services. The result is a bank-branded portal that integrates seamlessly with existing CRM operations, providing a comprehensive customer profile without the need for system replacements.</p>
<p>Achieving a balance between digital efficiency and the human touch is not just a necessity; it is the key to rebuilding trust and fostering business growth. Employees and customers alike demand this equilibrium. It&#8217;s time for banks to prioritize what truly matters – the human connection – in their pursuit of a successful and sustainable future in the ever-evolving landscape of digital banking.</p>
<p><strong>DeFi:</strong></p>
<p>A fierce battle is underway, shaping the future of digital finance, with participants ranging from traditional banks and fintechs to big tech, governments, and the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi). This dynamic landscape is undergoing significant transformations, reshaping our perspective on the future of financial services.</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Financial Services Platforms:</strong></p>
<p>A prevailing trend is the emergence of comprehensive financial services platforms. Both banks and fintechs are actively acquiring startups to broaden their service portfolios, creating &#8216;destination platforms.&#8217; These platforms, exemplified by Ant Financial and Tencent&#8217;s &#8216;super apps,&#8217; allow consumers to meet diverse needs seamlessly within a unified digital space.</p>
<p><strong>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs):</strong></p>
<p>As cash usage declines, central banks worldwide are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). China, a pioneer in this domain, has recently launched its CBDC wallet app, coinciding with the Winter Olympics. The shift from cash to digital currencies represents a monumental change for governments globally, with other nations expected to follow suit in adopting CBDCs gradually.</p>
<p><strong>DeFi and Blockchain Transformations:</strong></p>
<p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is reshaping the internet&#8217;s economic landscape through blockchain applications. Replicating financial system functions on blockchains like Ethereum, DeFi facilitates transactions, wallets, lending, and payments. The rise of decentralized networks and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offers new opportunities, potentially disrupting revenue dynamics controlled by Big Tech.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges and Considerations:</strong></p>
<p>While DeFi introduces new opportunities, it also poses challenges. Regulatory responses are yet to unfold, and the decentralized nature raises concerns about potential scams. Financial products in decentralized environments may pose difficulties in addressing fraudulent activities. Additionally, decentralized communities, while enhancing security and privacy, may complicate anti-money laundering efforts.</p>
<p>Strategic Imperatives for Banks:</p>
<p>Banks must recognize the potential of cryptocurrency and DeFi for payments and swiftly incorporate them into their strategies. The competition from decentralized alternatives could challenge the substantial margins enjoyed by incumbents like Visa and Mastercard. Embracing crypto payments and DeFi is not only crucial for staying relevant but also for maintaining competitiveness in this evolving landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and Considerations for Early Adopters:</strong></p>
<p>While being at the forefront of innovation offers advantages, it comes with inherent risks. Regulatory uncertainties, potential scams, and challenges in anti-money laundering monitoring are areas of concern. Lessons from Facebook&#8217;s experience with Diem, a blockchain-based payment system, underscore the challenges faced by early adopters and the need for careful navigation.</p>
<p>The digital finance arena is experiencing transformative shifts, and banks must proactively develop strategic scenarios to navigate this dynamic landscape. The coming year is expected to be pivotal in determining how these trends will unfold and impact the financial services sector. As the evolution of digital finance accelerates, staying ahead of the curve will be crucial for financial institutions to thrive in this rapidly changing environment.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Banking on Innovation: The Synergy Between Traditional Banks and Fintechs</h2>
<p>In a noteworthy shift, banks are pivoting from perceiving fintechs as competitors to recognizing them as valuable collaborators. The evolution of this partnership is reshaping the financial landscape, blending traditional trust with innovative solutions that align with evolving customer preferences.</p>
<p><strong>Unlocking the Potential of Embedded Fintech: </strong>Landon Glenn, CEO and founder of ASA, foresees a surge in the adoption of embedded fintech by financial institutions in the upcoming year. Embedded fintech, when executed effectively, has the potential to extend an institution&#8217;s brand and influence throughout various aspects of a customer&#8217;s e-commerce activities. This paradigm shift reflects a strategic move towards seamless integrations that enhance the overall customer experience.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges and Solutions: </strong>Despite the promising prospects, challenges loom on the horizon. Maximizing the benefits of these partnerships and ensuring large-scale financial integrations require strategic investments in fintech technology. Glenn highlights obstacles such as assembling the right team, vetting suitable fintech partners, and navigating complex core integrations while managing liability and risk. To overcome these challenges, Glenn advocates for a collaborative banking model, emphasizing partnerships at scale to streamline operations and empower customers with a diverse array of technological tools.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Investments and Automation: </strong>Looking ahead to 2023, banks are gearing up for strategic investments in technology to impact ROI and enhance margins. Joe Ehrhardt, CEO and founder of Teslar Software, underscores the importance of automation in this effort. Digitizing processes and automating workflows can significantly increase efficiency, save time, and address talent challenges by expediting onboarding processes. Modern tools like sophisticated CRM systems and digital communication options are expected to play a pivotal role in this technological evolution.</p>
<p><strong>Customer-Centric Approach: </strong>On a customer level, the focus in 2023 will shift towards integrating channel services to enhance efficiency and the overall customer experience. This approach will not only impact branch modernization but also enable institution employees to engage with customers in more interactive ways. The emphasis will be on simplicity and convenience, providing easy, digital-first methods for online opening and onboarding accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Navigating Economic Uncertainties: </strong>Despite these forward-looking initiatives, banks are cautioned to navigate economic uncertainties cautiously. Tim Hamilton, CEO and founder of Praxent, stresses the importance of achieving positive unit economics, especially in potentially recessionary times. Banks are urged to carefully prioritize features, projects, and marketing spend, making strategic choices aligned with their business type to avoid costly distractions.</p>
<p>Opening an account online in a digital bank requires knowledge and skills such as a deep understanding of each financial institution and what they would like to see in an application. First of all, it is necessary to consider the high load and high security level. Over the years,<strong class="golden"> Regulated United Europe</strong> has acquired many partners and our company can help not only open an account for your business, but also to advise on the choice of the provider to make sure you will have everything you need for your business.</p>

			<p>Capital gains tax is an important part of the tax system in many European countries and applies to gains realised on the sale of assets that have increased in value. Tax rates and conditions can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. However, there are common strategies and approaches that can help investors and entrepreneurs optimise and reduce their tax liabilities. In this article, we look at the key methods for reducing capital gains tax in Europe.</p>
<ol>
<li>Utilisation of grace periods</li>
</ol>
<p>In many European countries, long-term holding of assets may result in lower tax rates on capital gains. Investors should carefully plan the timing of asset sales to take advantage of possible benefits for a long holding period.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Reinvestment of profits</li>
</ol>
<p>Some jurisdictions offer tax incentives for profits reinvested in certain types of assets or projects. Reinvesting gains from the sale of assets in new investment projects may reduce or defer tax liabilities.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Utilisation of tax losses</li>
</ol>
<p>Tax losses incurred as a result of investment activities can be utilised to reduce the tax base of capital gains. Effective utilisation of tax losses requires careful planning and documentation of all transactions.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Structuring through investment funds</li>
</ol>
<p>Investing through specialised investment funds may offer tax advantages in some European countries. Funds often have favourable tax treatment for capital gains, which can reduce the overall tax burden for investors.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Inheritance and gift planning</li>
</ol>
<p>Transferring assets as an inheritance or gift can be a profitable strategy to minimise capital gains taxes in the long term. It is important to consider the tax consequences and possible benefits under national law.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>International tax planning</li>
</ol>
<p>For investors with assets in different countries, international tax planning can help optimise tax liabilities. The use of double tax treaties and structuring investments through jurisdictions with lower tax rates requires careful analysis and planning.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Minimising capital gains tax in Europe requires in-depth knowledge of local tax regimes and available optimisation strategies. Investors and entrepreneurs are advised to keep careful records of all investments and consult with professional tax advisors to develop an effective tax strategy.</p>
<h2>How to reduce capital gains tax in Albania</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Albania, in an effort to attract foreign investment and stimulate economic development, offers a number of measures to optimise tax liabilities, including capital gains tax. Albania has a capital gains tax rate of 15%, but investors and entrepreneurs can take advantage of various strategies to minimise this tax. In this article, we will look at the main approaches to minimise capital gains tax liabilities in Albania.</p>
<ol>
<li>Long-term ownership of assets</li>
</ol>
<p>One effective strategy to reduce capital gains tax is long-term holding of assets. In some cases, long-term holding of assets may provide tax benefits or even exemption from capital gains tax, depending on specific conditions and regulations.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Reinvestment of profits</li>
</ol>
<p>Reinvesting gains from the sale of assets in other investment projects or assets in Albania can be the basis for tax benefits. This strategy not only facilitates further business development, but also allows to defer or minimise tax liabilities.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Utilisation of losses</li>
</ol>
<p>Accounting for losses from investment activities can help to reduce the taxable capital gains tax base. It is important to properly document all losses and use them to offset gains from other investments, thus reducing the overall tax burden.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Structuring through legal entities</li>
</ol>
<p>Investing through legal entities, such as limited liability companies, can offer additional opportunities for tax optimisation. Structuring business and investments through such entities requires careful planning and knowledge of Albanian tax legislation.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Inheritance and gift planning</li>
</ol>
<p>The transfer of assets through inheritance or gift can be structured in such a way as to minimise tax liabilities. In Albania, there are certain tax incentives for transfers of assets between close relatives, which can be used to reduce capital gains tax.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Consultations with a tax specialist</li>
</ol>
<p>Given the complexity of tax legislation and constant changes in tax regulations, consultation with a qualified tax advisor is a key aspect of a successful tax strategy. Professional tax advisors can help identify the most effective ways to minimise tax liabilities in accordance with the current Albanian legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Reducing capital gains tax in Albania requires careful planning and a strategic approach. Utilising long-term investments, reinvesting profits, loss recognition, efficient structuring through legal entities, and inheritance and gift planning can significantly reduce the tax burden on investors and entrepreneurs. However, it is important to remember to comply with Albanian tax legislation and to regularly update your knowledge as it changes.</p>
<h2> How to reduce capital gains tax in Austria</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Austria, with its stable economy and favourable investment climate, attracts many investors. However, as in any developed jurisdiction, it is important to effectively manage tax liabilities, including capital gains tax. In Austria, capital gains tax is 27.5 per cent for individuals on most types of capital assets. The following are strategies that can help reduce this tax in Austria.</p>
<ol>
<li>Take advantage of the grace period of ownership</li>
</ol>
<p>For some types of assets, long-term holding may offer tax advantages. Although in Austria most capital assets are taxable regardless of the holding period, it is important to examine the specific conditions for each type of asset as there may be exceptions.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Reinvestment of profits</li>
</ol>
<p>Reinvestment of gains from the sale of assets in certain investment projects may offer tax benefits. In some cases, it may be possible to use the reinvested funds to reduce the tax base, resulting in lower tax liabilities.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Utilisation of tax losses</li>
</ol>
<p>Austrian law allows tax losses to be utilised to offset capital gains, thereby reducing the overall tax burden. This requires careful planning and documentation of all transactions to ensure tax compliance.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Selection of suitable investment instruments</li>
</ol>
<p>Some investment instruments in Austria offer favourable tax conditions. For example, investing through pension funds or certain types of life insurance can offer more favourable tax conditions compared to direct investments in shares or bonds.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Family tax planning</li>
</ol>
<p>The transfer of assets as part of family tax planning can be used to optimise the tax burden. Gifting assets to children or other close relatives as part of tax planning can reduce overall capital gains tax at the family level.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Consultations with a tax consultant</li>
</ol>
<p>Given the complexity of tax legislation and its volatility, it is strongly recommended that you consult a qualified tax advisor on a regular basis. This will allow you to stay abreast of the latest changes in the tax code and take advantage of all available tax incentives and strategies to minimise your tax liabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Minimising capital gains tax in Austria requires in-depth knowledge of local tax laws and available optimisation strategies. Using the above-mentioned approaches in combination with professional tax advice can help to significantly reduce the tax burden and maximise the return on investment.</p>

<p>In Andorra, as in many other jurisdictions, the long-term holding of investment assets offers tax advantages. Assets held for more than a certain period (usually more than 10 years) may be exempt from capital gains tax, making a long-term investment strategy particularly attractive.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Reinvestment of profits</li>
</ol>
<p>Reinvesting gains from the sale of assets in other investment projects or assets may offer opportunities to defer or reduce tax liabilities. In Andorra, reinvesting profits in real estate or a business within a certain time window after the sale may provide tax relief.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Utilisation of ownership structures</li>
</ol>
<p>The judicious use of corporate and trust structures can help optimise tax liabilities. Owning investment assets through companies or trusts incorporated in Andorra may offer more favourable capital gains tax treatment, depending on the particular structure and assets.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Inheritance and gift planning</li>
</ol>
<p>Transferring assets as part of inheritance planning or through gifting can be an effective strategy to minimise tax liabilities. In Andorra, certain transfers of assets between close relatives may benefit from tax incentives or exemptions.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Consultations with a tax advisor</li>
</ol>
<p>Given the complexity of tax law and its changes, seeking professional advice is highly recommended. Tax advisors specialising in Andorran tax law can provide up-to-date advice and help develop strategies to minimise tax liabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Andorra offers a favourable environment for investors, but effectively reducing capital gains tax requires a thorough understanding of local tax laws and available tax optimisation strategies. The use of long-term investments, reinvestment of profits, thoughtful inheritance and gift planning and professional tax advice can significantly reduce the tax burden, allowing investors to maximise the return on their investment in Andorra.</p>
<h2> How to reduce capital gains tax in Belgium</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Belgium offers a rather complex but attractive tax system for investors and entrepreneurs. Whilst there is no general capital gains tax for individuals, provided that investments are made as part of &#8220;normal private wealth management&#8221;, there are certain situations where gains from the sale of assets may be subject to taxation. In this article, we will look at strategies that can help to reduce capital gains tax liabilities in Belgium.</p>
<ol>
<li>Long-term investment</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the basic principles of the Belgian tax system is not to tax capital gains on personal investments if they are held over the long term. This means that avoiding short-term speculative transactions and holding investments for the long term can help avoid capital gains taxation.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Planning through investment funds</li>
</ol>
<p>Investing through investment funds, especially so-called &#8220;transparent&#8221; funds, can offer tax advantages. Such funds are generally not subject to taxation at the fund level and tax liabilities arise only when the investor realises assets, which can provide more control over tax planning.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Utilisation of tax losses</li>
</ol>
<p>In Belgium, investors can utilise losses incurred on the sale of certain assets to offset gains on the sale of other assets during the same tax period. This allows optimising the tax base and reducing the overall tax burden.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Structuring through the company</li>
</ol>
<p>For business investments, structuring through a company can offer tax advantages in Belgium. Companies can enjoy lower corporate tax rates and certain tax incentives, which can reduce the overall tax burden on capital gains.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Inheritance planning</li>
</ol>
<p>Effective inheritance and gift planning can help minimise capital gains tax liabilities in Belgium. The transfer of assets as a gift or inheritance can often avoid capital gains taxation if certain conditions and requirements are met.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Consultations with a tax specialist</li>
</ol>
<p>Given the complexity of tax legislation and its constant changes, it is strongly recommended to consult a qualified tax professional on a regular basis. This will allow you to stay up-to-date with the latest changes in tax policy and optimise your tax strategy in accordance with current legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Minimising capital gains tax in Belgium requires sound planning and a strategic approach. The use of long-term investments, investment funds, tax losses, corporate structuring and inheritance planning, as well as regular consultation with tax professionals, can help to significantly reduce tax liabilities and optimise the return on investments.</p>

</ol>
<p>Reinvesting gains from the sale of assets in other investment projects or assets within a certain time frame after the sale may offer tax benefits. Some regions provide tax incentives for reinvestment, which may reduce or defer tax liabilities.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Transfer of assets as a gift</li>
</ol>
<p>The transfer of assets as a gift or inheritance may offer tax advantages depending on the specific laws of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its regions. It is important to consider the rules and conditions applicable to such transfers in order to optimise tax liabilities.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Consultations with a tax specialist</li>

<h2> How to minimise capital gains tax in Denmark</h2>
<p>In order to reduce capital gains tax in Denmark, a number of key policies and local legislation should be considered. Denmark, as a developed economy, offers various approaches to optimise tax liabilities, especially in relation to capital gains. In this article, we will look at a few of the main methods that can help to reduce capital gains tax payments, focusing on investment strategy, utilisation of tax incentives and effective planning.</p>
<h3>Tax Deferred Investment Accounts</h3>
<p>One way to minimise capital gains tax is to use tax-deferred investment accounts. In Denmark, there are specialised accounts that offer the option of investing pre-tax income, allowing you to defer taxation until you withdraw the funds from the account. This can be favourable for investors planning deferred investments, as the tax rate at the time of withdrawal may be lower.</p>
<h3>Utilisation of Capital Losses</h3>
<p>Balancing capital gains and losses is another effective strategy. In Denmark, you can use losses incurred on some assets to reduce taxable income from other assets. This means that if you have investments that generate losses, you can &#8220;write off&#8221; these losses against the gains from other investments, thereby reducing the overall tax base.</p>
<h3>Annual Planning</h3>
<p>Effective annual tax planning can play a key role in minimising capital gains taxes. This may involve timing the sale of assets to maximise the use of personal tax relief or avoid selling in years with high overall income. It is important to plan each transaction carefully to optimise the tax consequences.</p>
<h3>Tax Benefits and Exemptions</h3>
<p>In Denmark, there are certain tax incentives and exemptions that can be applied to capital gains. For example, capital gains on the sale of a main residence are generally not taxable. It is also worth looking at possible incentives for investing in certain types of assets or participating in start-ups, which may offer tax incentives.</p>
<h3>Consultations with Specialists</h3>
<p>Finally, it is important to consult with tax specialists or financial advisors in Denmark for personalised advice and to develop a strategy that best suits your individual situation. Tax laws can be complex and professional help can make a significant difference to the effectiveness of your tax planning.</p>
<p>By following these strategies, it is possible to significantly reduce the tax burden on capital gains in Denmark, while optimising your investments and tax liabilities.</p>
<h2> How to minimise capital gains tax in Estonia</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Reducing capital gains tax in Estonia requires a comprehensive approach and a thorough understanding of local tax laws. Estonia, known for its innovative tax system, offers unique opportunities for businesses and investors, including an attractive capital gains tax environment. In this article, we will explore strategies to help minimise capital gains tax liabilities in Estonia, using business language and focusing on relevant and effective approaches.</p>
<h3>Optimisation through Estonian Company Taxation System</h3>
<p>Estonia is unique in that it does not levy tax on profits until they are distributed. This means that reinvested company income is not subject to capital gains tax. Investing profits back into business development, research or expansion can be a favourable strategy to reduce tax liabilities.</p>
<h3>Use of Tax Treaties to Avoid Double Taxation</h3>
<p>Estonia has signed double taxation treaties with numerous countries. These treaties can offer significant advantages for international investors and companies operating internationally. Understanding and applying these treaties can significantly reduce the tax burden on capital gains.</p>
<h3>Choosing the Right Company Structure</h3>
<p>The choice of legal form of a company in Estonia can have a significant impact on tax liabilities. For example, sole proprietors may enjoy certain tax benefits that are not available to legal entities. A careful analysis of the company&#8217;s business model and objectives will allow choosing the optimal structure to minimise capital gains tax.</p>
<h3>Temporary Revenue Planning and Allocation</h3>
<p>Careful planning of the timing of asset sales and income distributions can help to optimise tax liabilities. Considering deferring the sale of assets until the next tax period or choosing a time when total income is lower can reduce capital gains tax.</p>
<h3>Reinvestment of Profit</h3>
<p>Estonian tax legislation encourages reinvestment of profits. Reinvested profits can be exempted from tax, which provides an opportunity for capital growth without immediate tax consequences. This is especially relevant for start-ups and technology companies seeking rapid growth.</p>
<h3>Consultation with a Tax Advisor</h3>
<p>Consultation with a qualified tax advisor or auditor familiar with Estonian tax legislation can provide valuable advice and help you develop a tax strategy that best suits your business objectives. Professional planning and advice can help you avoid potential tax risks and optimise your tax liabilities.</p>
<p>By applying these strategies, companies and individual investors can significantly reduce their capital gains tax liabilities in Estonia. The Estonian tax system offers many opportunities for tax optimisation, but requires deep understanding and careful planning to implement them.</p>
<h2> How to reduce capital gains tax in Finland</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Reducing capital gains tax in Finland requires careful planning and understanding of local tax laws. Finland, with its progressive tax system, offers various ways for investors and entrepreneurs to minimise their capital gains tax liability. In this article, we will look at a number of strategies to help reduce capital gains tax by using business language and focusing on legal methods to optimise tax payments.</p>
<h3>Long-term Investing</h3>
<p>One of the key approaches to reducing capital gains tax in Finland is long-term investment. In Finland, the capital gains tax rate may depend on the holding period of the asset. Long-term investments are often taxed at lower rates than short-term investments. Thus, planning when to sell assets can significantly reduce the tax burden.</p>
<h3>Utilisation of Tax Deductions</h3>
<p>The Finnish Tax Code provides for the possibility of utilising various deductions that can reduce the taxable base of capital gains. For example, expenses related to the acquisition or sale of an asset can often be deducted from capital gains. It is important to consider all possible deductions in detail in order to optimise tax liabilities.</p>
<h3>Reinvestment of Profit</h3>
<p>In Finland, it is possible to reduce tax liabilities by reinvesting profits from the sale of assets. By reinvesting profits in certain types of assets within a set timeframe, investors can defer or reduce tax payments. This requires careful planning and an understanding of the criteria that must be met in order to utilise this benefit.</p>
<h3>Portfolio Optimisation</h3>
<p>Managing an investment portfolio to balance profitable and unprofitable investments can help minimise taxes. Losses incurred on some investments can be used to reduce the taxable income from other investments, effectively reducing the tax base.</p>
<h3>Family Taxation</h3>
<p>Finland also has certain tax strategies related to the distribution of investment income among family members. The distribution of investments and income between spouses or between parents and children can optimise the overall tax burden on the family, as different tax exemptions and rates are used.</p>
<h3>Consultations with Professionals</h3>
<p>Finally, tax advisors and financial experts should be consulted to maximise the reduction of tax liabilities. Professional advisors will not only help you correctly apply all available tax strategies, but also help you avoid potential tax planning mistakes.</p>
<p>By applying these strategies, it is possible to significantly reduce capital gains tax in Finland, thereby optimising investment activities and improving the overall financial situation.</p>
<h2> How to reduce capital gains tax in France</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Reducing capital gains tax in France is an important objective for investors seeking to optimise their tax liabilities and maximise investment returns. In France, capital gains tax applies to gains on the sale of assets, such as real estate and securities, and can significantly reduce net investment returns. However, there are several strategies that can help reduce this tax burden.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> To take advantage of grace periods of ownership</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In France, capital gains tax can be reduced depending on the length of ownership of the asset. For example, for real estate, there are discounts on the tax rate after a certain number of years of ownership, which increase each year and can lead to a full exemption after 22 years of ownership. For securities, there are also exemptions depending on the length of ownership.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Utilise the tax deferral mechanism</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One way to reduce the tax burden is to take advantage of tax deferral opportunities, for example, by reinvesting proceeds in certain assets or projects that defer or reduce taxation until these new investments are realised.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Optimisation of tax treatment of financial instruments</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Choosing the right tax regime for investments in securities and other financial instruments can significantly reduce capital gains tax. In France, there are various tax-advantaged investment accounts, such as PEA (Plan d&#8217;Epargne en Actions), which offer significant tax benefits for long-term equity investments.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Deduction of costs and losses</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When calculating capital gains tax, certain costs associated with the acquisition, ownership and sale of an asset, such as brokerage commissions, costs of repairs and improvements to the property, can be taken into account. In addition, losses on the sale of some assets may offset gains on the sale of other assets, which also helps to reduce the tax base.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Inheritance and gift planning</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In France, the transfer of assets by way of inheritance or gift can be a favourable strategy to reduce tax liabilities, as heirs and donee can benefit from certain tax advantages. It is important to plan such transfers carefully to optimise the tax consequences for both the donor and the recipient.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Reducing capital gains tax in France requires a comprehensive approach and careful planning. It is important to take into account individual circumstances and long-term financial goals, and to consult regularly with tax advisors to adapt the strategy to changing tax laws and market conditions. With the right approach, it is possible to significantly reduce the tax burden and maximise the net return on investment.</p>
<h2> How to reduce capital gains tax in Germany</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Reducing capital gains tax in Germany is an important part of the investment and tax planning strategy for investors and asset owners. In Germany, capital gains tax taxes tax income from the sale of assets such as real estate and securities. However, there are various strategies to minimise the tax liability for this type of tax.</p>
<h3>Utilisation of the Preferential Possession Period for Real Estate</h3>
<p>For real estate owned for more than 10 years, Germany provides an exemption from capital gains tax. This means that the sale of personal real estate or investment property after 10 years of ownership is not subject to capital gains tax, which can significantly reduce tax liabilities.</p>
<h3>Use the Exemption Rule for Personal Use</h3>
<p>If the property was used by the owner as a principal residence for a certain period of time immediately prior to the sale, the sale proceeds may also be exempt from capital gains tax. This rule allows owners who use the property for personal use to avoid tax liability when selling it.</p>
<h3>Compensation for Losses</h3>
<p>Investors can use losses from the sale of some assets to offset gains from the sale of other assets, thereby reducing the overall tax base. This is particularly relevant for a securities portfolio, where realisation of losses on some shares may be offset by gains on other transactions.</p>
<h3>Deductions and Expenses</h3>
<p>When calculating capital gains tax, various expenses related to the acquisition, ownership and sale of an asset can be taken into account, including notary, land registration and intermediary costs. For real estate, the costs of improvements and modernisation can also be taken into account, which helps to reduce taxable income.</p>
<h3>Choosing the Right Investment Form</h3>
<p>Investment products, such as investment funds or insurance products with an investment component, may offer more favourable tax treatment for long-term investors. In some cases, investing through certain funds or structures allows taxation to be deferred until the investment is realised or income is earned.</p>
<h3>Tax Planning and Consultancy</h3>
<p>Effective tax planning and consultation with a tax professional can help optimise tax liabilities. Professional tax advisors can offer customised solutions and strategies based on the client&#8217;s specific circumstances and objectives.</p>
<p>Reducing capital gains tax liabilities requires careful planning and knowledge of current tax rules and incentives. The implementation of effective strategies and regular tax planning contribute to optimising the tax burden and improving the overall financial performance of investments in Germany.</p>
<h2> How to reduce capital gains tax in Greece</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>The reduction of capital gains tax is a significant aspect of tax planning for investors and asset owners in Greece. Capital gains tax in Greece taxes income derived from the sale of certain types of assets such as real estate, shares and other securities. However, there are various methods and strategies that can help minimise this tax burden.</p>
<h3>Use of Possession Period for Real Estate</h3>
<p>In Greece, the sale of a property that has been owned for more than a certain period of time may allow capital gains tax exemptions to be utilised. For example, special taxation conditions may apply to property acquired before a certain date, making it important to know the ownership history of the asset.</p>
<h3>Optimisation of Asset Related Expenses</h3>
<p>Expenses incurred in the purchase, improvement and sale of assets can be deducted from taxable capital gains. This includes expenses such as commissions, legal and notary fees, and the cost of repairs and improvements to real estate.</p>
<h3>Reinvestment of Profit from Real Estate Sales</h3>
<p>In some cases, reinvesting the proceeds from the sale of real estate into new real estate assets can offer tax benefits. This can be a way to defer or reduce the tax liability associated with capital gains.</p>
<h3>Utilisation of Benefits for Transfer of Assets</h3>
<p>The transfer of assets as part of a family planning or gift can allow tax benefits to be utilised, reducing the tax base for capital gains. However, this requires careful planning and consultation with a tax advisor to optimise the tax consequences.</p>
<h3>Investment Accounts with Preferential Taxation</h3>
<p>Investments through special investment accounts or funds may offer the benefit of favourable tax treatment. Such instruments are designed to incentivise investment and may offer reduced capital gains tax rates or other tax benefits.</p>
<h3>Compensation for Capital Losses</h3>
<p>Offsetting losses from some investments with gains from others can help reduce the overall tax base. It is important to keep accurate records of all investment transactions to be able to utilise this strategy.</p>
<h3>Consultations with a Tax Specialist</h3>
<p>Given the complexity of tax law and frequent changes to the tax code, consulting with a qualified tax advisor or attorney can be invaluable for effective tax planning and reducing your capital gains tax liability.</p>
<p>Following these strategies can help investors and asset owners in Greece to reduce their tax liabilities and optimise their financial results. However, it is important to regularly review tax planning in line with current tax legislation and personal financial goals.</p>

Capital gains tax in Hungary is levied on income derived from the sale of assets such as real estate, shares, and other types of investment resources. It is important to know and use available strategies to minimise capital gains tax liabilities.</p>
<h3>Use of Holding Period to Reduce Tax Rate</h3>
<p>In Hungary, the duration of ownership of an asset may affect the capital gains tax rate. Long-term ownership of certain assets may qualify for a lower tax rate. This is particularly relevant for investments in real estate and securities, where the rules may differ depending on the type of asset.</p>
<h3>Deduction of Expenses and Investment Losses</h3>
<p>Expenses related to the acquisition, ownership and disposal of an asset can be deducted from the tax base of capital gains. This includes expenditure on repair, maintenance and improvement of assets, as well as legal and consulting fees.

<h2> How to minimise capital gains tax in Ireland</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Reducing capital gains tax in Ireland is an important aspect of tax planning for investors and asset owners seeking to maximise their income and minimise their tax liability. In Ireland, capital gains tax taxes capital gains realised on the sale of assets such as property, shares and other forms of investments. It is important to consider various strategies to minimise this tax.</p>
<h3>Utilisation of the Preferential Ownership Period</h3>
<p>Ireland does not have a capital gains tax rebate based on the length of time an asset has been held, as is the case in some other countries. However, it is important to keep up to date with changes in legislation as tax policy may change.</p>
<h3>Deduction of Expenses and Investment Losses</h3>
<p>Expenses related to the acquisition, ownership and sale of an asset can be deducted from the tax base of capital gains. This includes legal fees, commissions and costs of improving an asset that directly increase its value. In addition, losses incurred on the sale of some assets can be used to offset gains on the sale of other assets in the same tax year or carried forward to future years.</p>
<h3>Utilisation of Tax Deferral</h3>
<p>In Ireland, it is possible to defer taxation on the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of certain types of assets into new qualifying assets. This may allow investors to defer capital gains tax until the subsequent sale of the new assets.</p>
<h3>Implementation of the Harvesting Losses Strategy</h3>
<p>A &#8220;loss harvesting&#8221; strategy involves selling assets at a loss to offset taxable capital gains from other investments. This tactic can be particularly useful as part of a broad investment strategy aimed at minimising taxes.</p>
<h3>Tax Residency and International Treaties</h3>
<p>Tax residency status and the application of double tax treaties can have a significant impact on capital gains tax liabilities. Investors residing outside Ireland or holding overseas assets should carefully consider these aspects to optimise their tax burden.</p>
<h3>Consultations with a Tax Specialist</h3>
<p>Professional tax advice is essential to fully understand the complexities of Irish tax law and to utilise all available strategies to reduce capital gains tax. Tax advisers can help to develop an effective tax planning strategy, taking into account individual circumstances and objectives.</p>

<h3>Take advantage of the Reinvestment System</h3>
<p>Investors can reduce the tax base by reinvesting the proceeds from the sale of assets in qualified investment projects or real estate. It is important to note that such a strategy requires compliance with certain conditions and deadlines established by Italian tax law.</p>

This includes the costs of notary services, registration fees, as well as the costs of repairs and modernisation of real estate, which can significantly reduce taxable income.</p>
<h3>Utilisation of the Preferential Ownership Period</h3>
<p>Certain types of assets, including shares and equity interests in companies, are eligible for tax relief for long holding periods. For example, shares held for longer than a certain period may be subject to a lower capital gains tax rate.</p>
<h3>Compensation for Capital Losses</h3>
<p>Capital losses incurred during the tax year can be used to offset capital gains realised on other investments. This reduces the overall tax base and hence the amount of tax on capital gains.</p>
<h3>Optimisation of Tax Residency</h3>
<p>Tax residency status has a significant impact on the taxation of capital gains. In some cases, a change of tax residency or the use of double tax treaties between Italy and other countries may offer more favourable tax treatment.</p>

<h2> How to reduce capital gains tax in Slovenia</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Reducing capital gains tax in Slovenia is an important part of tax planning for investors and asset owners. Effective management of tax liabilities helps not only to increase the net return on investment, but also to optimise financial flows. In Slovenia, capital gains tax applies to gains realised on the sale of assets, including real estate, shares and other investment products. Let&#8217;s look at the key strategies to minimise capital gains tax liabilities.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Timing of Asset Realisation Planning</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The timing of the sale of an asset has a significant impact on the tax liability. In Slovenia, capital gains tax often depends on the period of ownership of the asset. Longer ownership of assets can lead to a lower tax rate, especially in the case of real estate. Careful planning of the timing of the sale allows you to take advantage of this advantage.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Utilisation of Benefits and Deductions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Certain costs associated with the acquisition, improvement and disposal of an asset may be deductible as capital gains, thereby reducing the tax base. Such expenses include legal fees, commissions and investment in the improvement of the asset. It is important to accurately document all costs to confirm their legitimacy.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Reinvestment of Profit</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Reinvesting the capital gains from the sale of an asset in new investment projects may offer tax advantages, including deferral of capital gains tax. However, in order to utilise this strategy, the conditions and restrictions imposed by Slovenian tax legislation must be carefully examined.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Investing through Specialised Funds</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Investments through specialised investment funds or structures may offer favourable tax treatment. In some cases, gains realised through such funds may be subject to capital gains tax at reduced rates or exempt from taxation altogether.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Optimisation of Tax Residency</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Tax residency status can affect the taxation of capital gains. Sometimes, reassignment of tax residency to another jurisdiction with a more favourable tax regime may offer additional opportunities for tax optimisation. However, such an approach requires detailed analysis and consultation with professionals.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> Professional Tax Consulting</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Comprehensive tax planning and consultations with qualified tax specialists are the key to successfully optimising tax liabilities. Tax advisors can offer customised solutions to suit the investor&#8217;s specific situation and help navigate through the complexities of Slovenian tax law.</p>
<p>The application of the above strategies in combination allows efficient management of capital gains tax liabilities in Slovenia, reducing the overall tax burden and improving the financial results of investment activities. It is important to remember that successful tax planning requires prior analysis and a thorough understanding of the current tax rules and regulations.</p>
<h2> How to reduce capital gains tax in Serbia</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>The reduction of capital gains tax in Serbia represents a significant element of tax planning for investors and asset owners seeking to optimise their financial results. In Serbia, capital gains tax imposes on income derived from the sale of assets such as real estate, shares and other types of investment property. Effective management of tax liabilities maximises income and minimises tax deductions.</p>
<h3>Main Approaches to Reducing Capital Gains Taxation</h3>
<p><strong>Utilisation of Legitimate Tax Deductions</strong></p>
<p>An important aspect of tax planning is to utilise all available tax deductions associated with the acquisition, ownership and sale of assets. This may include the cost of acquiring the asset, the cost of improvements and costs incurred in the sale process, such as intermediary commissions and legal fees.</p>
<p><strong>Optimisation of Ownership Periods</strong></p>
<p>In Serbia, the amount of capital gains tax may depend on the holding period of the asset. Long-term holding of assets often offers tax advantages, such as reduced tax rates or tax exemption. Planning the sale of an asset with an optimal holding period in mind can significantly reduce the tax burden.</p>
<p><strong>Reinvestment of Profit</strong></p>
<p>Reinvesting the proceeds from the sale of assets in new investment projects may provide tax benefits, such as deferral of capital gains tax. The specific conditions and requirements for implementing such a strategy should be carefully considered.</p>
<p><strong>Compensation for Losses</strong></p>
<p>Investors can use losses incurred on the sale of some assets to offset gains on the sale of other assets. This reduces the overall tax base and hence the amount of capital gains tax.</p>
<p><strong>Investments through Legal Entities</strong></p>
<p>Investing through legal entities such as companies or partnerships can offer additional tax advantages and optimisation of capital gains taxation. However, the choice of structure should be consistent with both investment objectives and tax planning.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Tax Consulting</strong></p>
<p>Consultation with qualified tax professionals familiar with Serbian tax legislation and its application is a key element of successful tax planning. Tax advisors will help identify the most effective strategies to reduce tax liabilities and minimise risks.</p>
<p>Applying these approaches in combination allows investors and asset owners in Serbia to effectively manage their capital gains tax liabilities, reducing their overall tax burden and improving their financial performance.</p>
<h2>How to reduce capital gains tax in Spain</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>The reduction of capital gains tax in Spain is a significant aspect of tax planning for investors and asset owners seeking to optimise their tax liabilities and improve investment returns. In Spain, Capital Gains Tax taxes income derived from the sale of assets such as real estate, shares and other investment products. Effective management of tax liabilities can significantly reduce the tax burden.</p>
<h3>Basics of Taxation of Capital Gains in Spain</h3>
<p>In Spain, capital gains tax rates vary depending on the amount of profit, with a maximum rate of up to 26%. However, there are various methods and strategies to minimise this tax liability.</p>
<h3>Capital Gains Tax Reduction Strategies</h3>
<p><strong>Use of Deductions and Deductions</strong></p>
<p>One key strategy is to utilise the deductions and credits available to reduce the tax base. This includes costs associated with acquiring, owning and selling an asset, such as commissions, legal fees and costs to improve the asset. Thorough documentation of these expenses is critical to the approval of deductions.</p>
<p><strong>Loss carryforwards</strong></p>
<p>In Spain, losses from the sale of assets can be carried forward and used to offset future capital gains over a period of time. This allows investors to utilise unsuccessful investments to reduce tax liabilities from more successful transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Long-term Asset Ownership</strong></p>
<p>Although Spain does not provide default relief for long-term holding of assets, in some cases strategic planning of the timing of asset sales can help optimise tax liabilities through more favourable tax terms or changes in tax legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Reinvestment of Profit from Real Estate Sales</strong></p>
<p>In Spain, there is a tax relief for reinvesting profits from the sale of a main residential property in the purchase of a new main residential property. This may allow full exemption from capital gains tax if certain conditions are met.</p>
<p><strong>Investment Accounts with Preferential Taxation</strong></p>
<p>The use of special investment accounts can offer favourable tax treatment for long-term investments. This includes retirement accounts and other tax-advantaged investment products.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Tax Consulting</strong></p>
<p>Obtaining professional tax advice from experts familiar with Spanish tax law helps identify the best tax planning strategies to suit the investor&#8217;s individual circumstances.</p>
<p>The application of these strategies allows investors and asset owners in Spain to significantly reduce their capital gains tax burden, optimising their investments and improving their financial results.

<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Investing through Investment Accounts</strong></li>

<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Long-term Ownership of Assets</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In some cases, long-term asset ownership can offer tax advantages, especially when it comes to real estate and stocks. Strategic planning for the sale of assets can help to optimise tax liabilities.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Optimisation of Capital Losses</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Capital losses can be used to offset capital gains, thereby reducing the overall tax burden. Effective management of the investment portfolio maximises the use of capital losses.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Professional Tax Consulting</strong></li>

<p>Consultation with tax specialists and financial advisors familiar with Swedish tax law can provide valuable guidance and help to develop an effective tax planning strategy.</p>

<h2> How to minimise capital gains tax in UK</h2>
<p>Reducing capital gains tax in the UK is an important part of tax planning for investors and asset owners. Given that capital gains tax imposes a tax on gains realised on the sale of assets such as property, shares and other investments, effective management of these liabilities can significantly improve investment returns. The UK offers several mechanisms and strategies to optimise tax payments that can be used by investors.</p>
<h3>Main Strategies for Reducing Capital Gains Taxation</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use of the Personal Tax Threshold</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Each UK taxpayer has a personal capital gains tax threshold within which capital gains are not taxed. Effective use of this threshold helps to minimise tax liabilities.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Loss carryforwards</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Losses incurred on the disposal of capital assets can be used to reduce the taxable capital gains base, thereby reducing the tax burden. This requires accurate accounting and strategic planning of asset sales.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Use of the </strong><strong>Bed and Breakfasting </strong><strong>System</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Traditionally, investors have used a &#8216;bed and breakfasting&#8217; strategy &#8211; selling shares at the end of the tax year and buying them again the next day to realise capital losses or gains within the annual exemption threshold. However, modern UK tax law contains rules designed to combat such schemes. It is important to be mindful of these restrictions and look for legitimate ways to optimise tax.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Investments through ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>ISAs offer tax relief for investments in stocks and shares, allowing the income from these investments to grow tax free on income and capital gains. The use of ISAs is an effective strategy for reducing the tax burden on investment income.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Distribution of Assets between Spouses</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The transfer of assets between spouses is not subject to capital gains tax. This allows the couple to utilise a double annual tax deduction, minimising the tax burden on the sale of assets.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Professional Tax Consulting</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Seeking professional tax advice helps ensure compliance with tax laws while optimising tax liabilities. Tax specialists can offer personalised advice and strategies based on the latest changes in legislation and tax practice.</p>
<p>Applying these strategies requires a thorough understanding of UK tax legislation and careful investment planning. By complying with tax rules while effectively managing tax liabilities, investors can improve the financial performance of their investments.</p>

			<p>The European Union trade mark has a single legal protection and is valid on the territory of all EU member states at the same time, i.e. it can be registered, transferred to another owner, its registration can be cancelled or its use can be prohibited on the territory of all 28 member states of the European Union at the same time.</p>
<p>Registration of the European Community trade mark is carried out at the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), which is located in Alicante, Spain. Registration of the European trade mark is made by filing a single application in one of the five EUIPO languages and paying a single fee. The term of validity of the European trade mark is 10 years with the possibility to extend this term for another 10 years for an unlimited number of times.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages of the European Trade Mark:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Obtaining a trade mark protection document in all 28 countries of the European Union upon submission of a single application and payment of a single fee;</li>
<li>Submission of a single application with uniform formal requirements;</li>
<li>To avoid termination of the trade mark on the grounds of non-use for 5 years, it is sufficient to prove its use in only one of the EU countries.</li>
</ol>

			<h2>Stages of registration of a European Community trade mark</h2>
<ol>
<li>Submission of an application</li>
</ol>
<p>The application is submitted to the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) and must contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>a statement which contains the applicant&#8217;s details;</li>
<li>list of goods and services for which the trade mark is applied for;</li>
<li>trademark image.</li>
</ul>
<p>A single application fee is charged, the amount of which may vary depending on the number of classes of goods and services specified.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the applicant is entitled to priority for 6 months after filing an application for registration of an identical trade mark in any country party to the Paris Convention.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Search</li>
</ol>
<p>The search is carried out by the EUIPO after the application is assigned a filing date. The search is necessary to identify trade marks already registered or filed for registration which may subsequently prevent the registration of the applied-for trade mark.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the applicant may obtain not only the basic search report but also the reports of the central industrial property offices of the Member States of the Union. It is necessary to specify which country reports are required and to pay the appropriate fee for each country selected. The search reports are available within 2 months from the date of filing of the application.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Publication of the application</li>
</ol>
<p>If the application meets all requirements, EUIPO publishes the application.</p>
<p>Within 3 months after publication of the application, third parties have the right to file an opposition against the registration of the trade mark.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Registration</li>
</ol>
<p>If no opposition has been filed within 3 months from the date of publication or the opposition has been contested, the mark is published in the Official Gazette and an electronic version of the certificate of registration of the mark is sent to the applicant/applicant&#8217;s representative. A paper version of the certified or uncertified copy of the original certificate of registration may be issued upon request.</p>
<h2>Patenting in Europe</h2>
<p>A European patent is a protection document granted by the European Patent Organisation. The European Patent System is based on co-operation between the European Patent Office and the national offices of the Contracting States (List of Contracting States).</p>
<p>The main idea of the European Patent is the possibility of obtaining patent protection in 44 countries on the basis of a single application filed with the European Patent Office in one of the official languages (English, German or French). As a rule, the registration procedure takes 3 years.</p>
<p>It is also possible to obtain a European patent under the Euro-PCT procedure, under which European patents can be granted on the basis of an international application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).</p>
<p>A European patent is an easier and cheaper way to obtain patent protection if the patent is applied for in at least 3-4 European countries.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages of the European Patent:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Significant cost savings;</li>
<li>Simplification of the registration procedure, as all application records are kept in one language. Search, examination and granting of a patent is carried out once;</li>
<li>In validation, a number of European Patent Convention countries have relaxed the conditions for filing translations of application documents into national languages (London Agreement).</li>
</ol>
<h3>The stages of obtaining a European Patent</h3>
<ol>
<li>Submission of an application</li>
</ol>
<p>The application shall be filed with the European Patent Office (EPO) in one of the official languages of the EPO (English, French, German) and shall consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>statements;</li>
<li>of the claims;</li>
<li>of the description of the invention;</li>
<li>drawings (if necessary);</li>
<li>abstract.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, according to Article 75 of the European Patent Convention, it is possible to file a European application through the national patent offices of the contracting countries, if this is allowed by the legislation of that country.</p>
<p>Substantive examination may also be claimed and paid for at the same time as the application is filed. Alternatively, the examination is claimed 6 months after the date of entry in the European Patent Gazette of information on the publication of the search report on the application, upon receipt of the relevant EPO notice.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Formal examination of the application</li>
</ol>
<p>This stage determines whether the application meets the formal requirements and the application is assigned a submission date.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Search</li>
</ol>
<p>A search is carried out by the EPO to determine the state of the art and novelty of the invention for which a patent is sought. Once a patent search has been carried out, a report is sent to the applicant indicating whether the claimed invention fulfils the requirements of the European Patent Convention and therefore what the chances of obtaining a patent are.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Publication of the application</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally, publication of the application is made together with the patent search report, namely after 18 months from the filing or priority date. Within 6 months, the applicant must file a request and pay a substantive examination fee. From the moment of publication, the European application receives provisional legal protection in all member states of the EPC.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Substantive expertise</li>
</ol>
<p>The purpose of substantive examination is to determine whether the claimed invention complies with the requirements of the European Patent Convention. Substantive examination is carried out by the Examining Board of the European Patent Office, which usually consists of three persons. In this way, the most objective judgement on the examination is made.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Decision on granting a patent and its publication</li>
</ol>
<p>The decision that a patent may be granted shall be taken by the Examining Board. The decision to grant becomes effective upon publication in the European Patent Gazette. The publication of the decision is subject to the payment of publication and granting fees as well as the payment of a maintenance fee. In addition, a translation of the claims into the other two official languages must be provided. The time limit for payment of these official fees and the filing of a translation of the claims is 4 months from the date of the judgement. Thus, the European patent obtained is a set of national patents in each of the EPC countries. However, in order to obtain patent protection in the selected countries, national validations in those countries are required.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Validation</li>
</ol>
<p>National validations usually take place within three months from the date of publication of the decision to grant a European patent. During the validation process, a translation of the application materials into the national languages of the selected countries must be provided and official validation fees must be paid. However, due to the London Agreement, the translation requirements have been greatly simplified in a number of EPC countries and consequently the financial burden on the applicant during the validation phase has been significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Thus, according to this agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>filing a European application in English ensures automatic validation of the European patent in the UK, Germany, France, Switzerland/Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Monaco without the need to provide national translations or appoint local patent attorneys;</li>
<li>where the application is filed in English in countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden, Croatia, Denmark and Iceland, only a translation of the claims should be provided;</li>
<li>when validating in Latvia and Slovenia a European application filed in any of the official languages of the European Patent Office, only a translation of the claims should be provided.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a European patent has been granted, annual fees for the maintenance of the patent are paid to the national offices of the said states.</p>
<p>Thus, the use of the European patent system offers the following advantages to the applicant:</p>
<ul>
<li>reducing the cost, time and labour intensity of patenting in a number of countries in Europe;</li>
<li>in each of the Contracting States in the territory of which the European patent is in force, the patentee shall be granted the same rights as if he had obtained a national patent in that State.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Registration of industrial designs in the European Union</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to Article 3 of Council Regulation No. 6/2002 on Community designs, a design is the appearance of the whole or part of a product, in particular the lines, contours, colours, shape, texture and/or materials of the product itself and/or its decoration.</li>
<li>The European Community industrial design enjoys legal protection simultaneously in the territory of all 28 countries of the European Union. There are two ways to register an industrial design simultaneously in the whole territory of the European Union.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Registration of the industrial design with EUIPO:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A single application for industrial design registration may be filed with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). The term of validity of a registered design in the European Union is 5 years from the date of filing. This term may be extended several times for a further 5 years until the maximum term of registration is reached, which is 25 years.</li>
<li>It should be noted that an unregistered European Community design is also subject to protection under EUIPO legislation. However, the term of such protection is shorter and amounts to 3 years from the moment when the information about this design becomes publicly available in the territory of the European Union. This type of protection is favourable for such industrial designs which are in demand for a rather short period of time. The owner of an unregistered industrial design has the right to prohibit third parties from directly copying his object, but in case of infringement of his rights, the obligation to prove the fact of ownership of the industrial design falls on the owner himself.</li>
<li>The procedure for registering an industrial design with EUIPO is as follows. After the application is submitted to the Office, it is formally examined and, if it fulfils the formal requirements, it is registered in the European Register of Industrial Designs and published in the Official Journal of the European Community on the EUIPO website.</li>
<li>From the moment of publication, the registration becomes automatically effective throughout the European Union. If the application passes the formal examination without any problems, the Office will register the industrial design within 2-4 months after the application has been filed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>International registration of an industrial design under the Hague System:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The second way to register an industrial design in the territory of the European Community is to designate the EU as the chosen country in the international registration of industrial designs under the Hague system, which is carried out by the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). Under this system, when filing an application, the applicant indicates, from a list of countries and regional organisations party to the Hague Agreement, which also includes the European Union (implying EUIPO competence), those countries and organisations in which he plans to obtain protection for his industrial design. Thus, by filing a single application under the Hague system specifying the European Union and other countries, it is possible to obtain patent protection for an industrial design both in the territory of the European Union and in other countries party to the Hague Agreement. An international design registration extended to the European Community has the same scope of legal protection as a European Community design registered through the EUIPO.</li>
<li>However, applicants should note that while an applicant can apply for a &#8220;European&#8221; design patent at the EUIPO either as a citizen of a Member State of the European Union or from any other country, only applicants from Member States of the Hague Agreement have the right to file an international design application under the Hague system. If the applicant is a person from a country which has not ratified the Hague Agreement, such an applicant will be able to obtain design protection throughout the territory of the European Union only by filing an application directly with the EUIPO.</li>
<li>Validity of the international registration</li>
<li>The term of registration of the industrial design in the territory of the European Union is the same as for the registration of the industrial design in the EUIPO, namely 5 years from the date of filing of the application and can be extended several times for another 5 years until the maximum term of registration of 25 years is reached.</li>
<li>The international procedure for registering an industrial design in the European Union is as follows. Once the application is filed with WIPO, it is formally examined and, if it fulfils the formal requirements, it is registered in the International Register of Industrial Designs and published in the International Bulletin on the WIPO website.</li>
<li>From the moment of publication, the international registration becomes automatically effective in the territory of the European Union. The procedure for registration of an industrial design in the European Union under the Hague System takes on average about 6 months.</li>
<li>It should be noted that both under EUIPO law and under the Hague Agreement, if it is necessary to preserve the novelty of an industrial design for a longer period of time, the applicant has the right to request a delay in the publication of the industrial design for a maximum of 30 months from the filing date of the application or, if priority is claimed, from the priority date.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Procedure and some peculiarities of obtaining a patent from the Eurasian Patent Organisation (EAPO)</strong></p>
<p>The Eurasian system is based on a single patent that is automatically valid in the territory of all member states of the Eurasian Patent Convention, more precisely in the territory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Russian Federation;</li>
<li>of the Republic of Kazakhstan;</li>
<li>Turkmenistan;</li>
<li>of the Republic of Belarus;</li>
<li>Republic of Tajikistan;</li>
<li>of the Republic of Azerbaijan;</li>
<li>Kyrgyz Republic;</li>
<li>Republic of Armenia.</li>
<li>Georgia</li>
</ul>
<p>A Eurasian patent application may be filed by a natural or legal person, irrespective of his/her nationality, domicile or location. Applicants who do not have their domicile or residence in the territory of a State party to the Convention must be represented by Eurasian patent attorneys.</p>
<p>The procedure for obtaining a Eurasian patent involves filing a single application in Russian and is conditionally divided into two stages. The first stage includes setting the filing date of the Eurasian application, formal examination, search and publication of the application. The second stage begins with substantive examination and ends with the Eurasian Patent Organisation&#8217;s decision to grant or refuse a patent.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that a Eurasian patent can also be obtained under the PCT procedure. An international application may be transferred to the regional phase of examination by the Eurasian Office, and the time limit for transferring an international application to the regional phase is 31 months from the date of the earliest priority.</p>
<p>The term of validity of a Eurasian patent is 20 years from the date of filing of the Eurasian application. It is worth noting that the twenty-year term of a Eurasian patent can be extended in those states parties to the Convention whose legislation provides for the extension of the term. The applicant must pay annual fees for the maintenance of the Eurasian patent in those states in which he is interested in patent protection of his invention.</p>
<p>The procedure for obtaining a patent from the Eurasian Patent Organisation (EAPO) offers the following advantages to applicants:</p>
<ul>
<li>filing a single Eurasian application instead of separate applications with national patent offices;</li>
<li>the need for one representative (Eurasian Patent Attorney) for all stages of examination of the application at the EAPO;</li>
<li>keeping records in one language (Russian), which reduces translation costs;</li>
<li>passing a single substantive examination, saving time and money;</li>
<li>the possibility of accelerating the time of consideration of a Eurasian application;</li>
<li>coverage of a vast territory by a single Eurasian patent;</li>
<li>no need for national validations, the Eurasian patent is valid automatically in those countries where the applicant has paid annual maintenance fees;</li>
<li>simplified procedure for payment of annual patent maintenance fees &#8211; for one country or a number of countries, annual fees are paid directly to the EAPO;</li>
<li>obtaining a &#8220;strong&#8221; Eurasian patent granted as a result of substantive examination.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, we can confidently state that if you need patent protection for your clients&#8217; inventions in more than two CIS countries, obtaining a Eurasian patent is absolutely the right solution.</p>
<p>Registering your trade mark in the European Union is an important step to protect your brand and the uniqueness of your goods or services in the EU single market. This process allows your trade mark to be legally protected in all EU member states. Understanding the procedures and requirements will help you effectively manage your trade mark rights and avoid potential legal disputes.</p>
<p><strong> 1. Selecting the registration format</strong></p>
<p>First, you need to determine what type of trade mark registration is appropriate for your purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>National registration: The </strong>process of registration in each individual EU member state separately.</li>
<li><strong>European Trade Mark (EUTM): </strong>One application gives protection in all member states of the European Union.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> 2. Preparing for registration</strong></p>
<p>Before applying for trade mark registration, a thorough analysis must be carried out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Checking the uniqueness of a trade mark: </strong>Use the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) databases to check whether a similar or identical mark has already been registered.</li>
<li><strong>Determining the classes of goods and services: </strong>Determine in which classes your goods or services will be protected under the Nice classification.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> 3. Application process</strong></p>
<p>The application for registration of a European trade mark can be submitted online via the EUIPO portal:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forming an application: </strong>Fill in the application form, indicating all the necessary information about the trade mark and attach an image if the mark is graphic.</li>
<li><strong>Payment of fees: The </strong>registration fee per application depends on the number of classes of goods and services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Expertise and publication</strong></p>
<p>Once an application is submitted, EUIPO will conduct an eligibility review:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check for explicit grounds for refusal: For </strong>example, lack of distinctiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Publication in the EUIPO Bulletin: </strong>After an initial check, your application will be published, allowing third parties to file objections.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> 5. Registration and validity of trade mark</strong></p>
<p>If no objections are raised or successfully overcome, your trade mark will be registered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Term of registration: </strong>The trade mark registration is valid for 10 years with the possibility of renewal.</li>
<li><strong>Trade mark protection: </strong>Registration gives the right to legal protection against unauthorised use of the mark throughout the European Union.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Registering a trade mark in the EU is a key element of an intellectual property protection strategy to strengthen your business&#8217; position in the European market. Successful registration requires careful planning and may require the assistance of professional lawyers specialising in intellectual property rights.</p>
<h2> Trademark registration process</h2>
<p>Registering a trade mark is a critical step to protect the uniqueness of your brand and its assets. Proper trade mark registration not only prevents conflicts with competitors, but also strengthens the company&#8217;s position in the market. In this article we will look at the main stages of the trade mark registration process.</p>
<p><strong> 1. Preparing for registration</strong></p>
<p>The first step is preparation, which includes the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand definition: </strong>Choose a unique brand name, which may include words, logos, symbols or combinations of these.</li>
<li><strong>Uniqueness check: </strong>Use national and international databases to check to make sure that a similar trade mark has not been registered by others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> 2. Selection of classes of goods and services</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classification of goods and services: </strong>Identify which classes under the International Classification of Goods and Services your goods or services belong to. This will help to pinpoint the exact area of protection of your brand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> 3. Submitting an application</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Formation and filing of the application: </strong>File an application with the national or international patent office. The application must contain the full name of the applicant, an image of the mark (if graphic), a list of the goods and services for which the mark is being registered and proof of payment of the necessary fees.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Examination of the application</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Formal and Substantive Examination: The </strong>Patent Office will check your application for compliance with the formal requirements and will examine you to ensure that the mark is distinctive and that there are no obstacles to registration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> 5. Publication and objections</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Publication of the application: </strong>After initial verification, the application is published in the official gazette, allowing third parties to file objections to the registration of the mark within a certain period of time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> 6. Registration and use of the mark</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Completion of registration: </strong>If no objections are received or successfully overcome, the patent office issues a trade mark registration certificate.</li>
<li><strong>Term of validity and renewal: A </strong>trade mark is usually registered for a period of 10 to 20 years, depending on the laws of the country, with the possibility of renewal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The process of registering a trade mark requires careful planning and understanding of the legal nuances. At each stage, difficulties may arise that require a professional approach. It is recommended to use the services of qualified lawyers or patent attorneys who will help to effectively manage the process of registration and protection of your trade mark.</p>
<h2> International trademark registration</h2>
<p>International trade mark registration allows you to protect your brand not only in your country but also in other countries, which is essential for companies seeking global expansion. The international registration process is organised by the Madrid System for the International Registration of Marks, which is administered by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Preparing for registration</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Before starting an international registration, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define </strong>your brand name<strong>: </strong>Make sure your brand name is unique and can be registered.</li>
<li><strong>Conduct a preliminary search: </strong>Research WIPO databases and national registers to determine whether similar or identical marks exist.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Selection of countries for registration</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Country identification: </strong>Select the countries in which you want to protect your brand based on your business interests and market strategy.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Submitting an application</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic Registration: </strong>You must have a national registration or application for registration in your country before you can apply internationally.</li>
<li><strong>Using the Madrid Registration System: </strong>File an international application through your national patent office or directly with WIPO if your country is a member of the Madrid Protocol.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Process and timing</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>WIPO examination:</strong> WIPO carries out a formal examination of your application and registers it if there are no objections at the formal stage.</li>
<li><strong>Examination by Member States: </strong>After WIPO registration, each country named in your application will conduct its own examination according to its own legislation. Countries have the right to refuse registration in their territory within a certain period of time, usually 12-18 months.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Legal aspects</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Validity Period:</strong> International registration is valid for 10 years with the possibility of renewal.</li>
<li><strong>Registration Management: </strong>All changes, such as transfer of rights, change of address or owner name, should be communicated through WIPO.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>International trade mark registration is a complex process that requires careful planning and an understanding of the international legal framework. It offers significant advantages, allowing you to protect your brand in multiple countries at the same time. Successfully navigating the process often requires the assistance of professional lawyers specialising in international intellectual property law to help avoid potential difficulties and speed up the registration process.</p>
<h2> Trademark registration in Albania</h2>
<p>Registering your trade mark in Albania is an important step to protect your brand in the Albanian market. It will not only legally protect your trademark from misuse by competitors, but also significantly strengthen the position of your business. In this article we will review the main stages of trade mark registration in Albania and outline the key points to pay attention to.</p>
<p><strong> 1. Preparatory phase</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of preparatory steps to be taken before applying for trade mark registration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Checking the uniqueness of the trade mark: </strong>Use national databases to make sure that your trade mark does not duplicate already registered ones. This can be done through the Albanian Patent Office (General Directorate of Patents and Trademarks).</li>
<li><strong>Definition of classes of goods and services:</strong> According to the Nice Classification, define the classes of goods and services for which the mark will be registered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> 2. Submitting an application</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation: </strong>Prepare and submit an application, which should include the name and address of the applicant, a representation of the trade mark (if graphic), a list of the goods or services to which the mark relates.</li>
<li><strong>Language of application: </strong>All documents must be submitted in Albanian language.</li>
<li><strong>Fees: </strong>Pay the required registration fees, the amount of which depends on the number of classes of goods and services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3 Examination of the application</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Formal verification: </strong>After filing the application, the Albanian Patent Office will carry out a formal verification of the documents for compliance with the requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Substantive Examination: </strong>Examiners will examine the trade mark to determine whether there are grounds for refusing registration, such as lack of distinctiveness or similarity to already registered marks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> 4. Publication and objections</strong></p>

<h2> Trademark registration in Germany</h2>
<p>Trade mark registration in Germany is a strategic step to protect your brand and its components such as names, logos and slogans. This process provides legal protection for intellectual property and prevents your brand from being used without authorisation. This article details the steps involved in registering a trade mark in Germany.</p>
<p><strong> 1. Preparatory stage: analysis and preliminary search</strong></p>
<p>Before applying for registration, it is important to carry out a thorough analysis of existing trade marks via the online services of the German Patent Office (DPMA). This eliminates the risk of rejection due to similarities with already registered marks. The preparation of a high-quality preliminary search reduces the likelihood of legal disputes after the registration of the mark.</p>
<p><strong>2. Identification of classes of goods and services</strong></p>
<p>Choosing the correct classification of goods and services according to the International Classification of Goods and Services (Nice Classifier) is critical to protecting a company&#8217;s interests. Errors in classification can lead to inadequate protection and possible infringements.</p>
<p><strong> 3. Submission of an application for registration</strong></p>
<p>The application for trade mark registration can be submitted electronically via the DPMA web portal or directly at the DPMA office. It is necessary to fill in all fields of the application carefully, provide clear images of the brand and describe the list of goods and services that will be associated with the brand. It is also important to complete all documents correctly, which requires knowledge of the specifics of German trade mark law.</p>
<p><strong>4. Expertise and publication</strong></p>
<p>The filing of the application is followed by a formal verification and examination stage. If the application meets all the requirements, it is registered for public access, which allows third parties to file an opposition to the registration of the mark. This stage is critical, as oppositions can seriously delay the registration process or even lead to its suspension.</p>
<p><strong> 5.Registering a mark and obtaining a certificate</strong></p>
<p>If no objections are received within three months of publication, or if all objections have been successfully resolved, the DPMA registers the mark and an official certificate is issued to the applicant. This document confirms the company&#8217;s exclusive right to use the registered trade mark within Germany.</p>

<h3>Significance of trade mark registration</h3>
<p>Registering a brand gives the owner exclusive rights to use the brand for trade and commercial purposes throughout the country.

<h3>Stages of trade mark registration</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Preliminary search</strong></p>
<p>Before filing an application for registration, a preliminary search must be carried out to determine whether the mark is free for registration.

<p><strong>Step 2: Submitting an application</strong></p>
<p>The application for registration of a trade mark can be submitted electronically or in paper form through the IGE/IPI. The application must specify and describe precisely the goods and services to be covered by the trade mark, according to the Nice Classifier.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Verification and review of the application</strong></p>
<p>Once filed, the application undergoes a formal eligibility check and a substantive check for uniqueness and distinctiveness. The IGE/IPI checks that the mark is not deceptive, does not infringe the public interest and does not conflict with already registered marks.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Publicity and objections</strong></p>
<p>If the application fulfils all the criteria, it is published in the official Swissreg gazette, giving third parties three months to file an opposition to the registration. Objections may be lodged if a party considers that the registration of the mark would infringe its rights.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Registering and obtaining a certificate</strong></p>
<p>Upon completion of all checks and no objections, the trade mark is registered and the owner receives an official certificate confirming his rights to the mark. The registered trade mark has a validity period of 10 years with the possibility of renewal.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The process of registering a trade mark in Switzerland requires care and precision at every stage.

<p>If no objections are received or successfully resolved, the mark is registered and the owner receives a certificate of registration. A registered trade mark is protected in the UK for a renewable period of 10 years.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Registering a trade mark in the UK not only strengthens the legal protection of your brand, but also enhances its commercial value, helping your company to grow and become more recognisable in the marketplace. By following these steps, and possibly engaging professional advisers, you can effectively protect your intellectual property rights.</p>

			<p>In 2024, analyses of average salaries across Europe continue to show significant diversity, reflecting differences in economic development, cost of living and tax policies in each country. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of average salaries based on available data and research and is designed to provide valuable information for employees, employers and labour market researchers.</p>
<p><strong>Key Trends</strong></p>
<p>Average salaries in Europe in 2023 continue to vary by region, with high values in Western Europe and lower values in Eastern Europe. Scandinavian countries, Luxembourg, Switzerland and the Netherlands show the highest average salaries, while Balkan and Eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and Romania show lower values.</p>
<p><strong>Average Salary by Country</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luxembourg </strong>maintains its leading position with one of the highest average salaries in Europe, exceeding €3,400 per month per hand. This reflects the country&#8217;s high standard of living and developed economy.</p>
<p><strong>Switzerland </strong>also stands out with an average salary of around €5,000 per month, indicating a high level of income and cost of living.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Nordic countries </strong>(Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland), the average salary is between 2,500 and 3,500 euros per month, emphasising strong social guarantees and high taxes.</p>
<p><strong>The UK </strong>and <strong>Germany </strong>show average salaries of around €2,000-2,500 per month, reflecting the stability and maturity of their economies.</p>
<p>In <strong>Eastern Europe, </strong>such as <strong>Poland </strong>and the <strong>Czech Republic, </strong>average salaries are in the range of €800 to €1,200, reflecting rapid economic growth and increased investment in the region.</p>
<p><strong>Impact on the Labour Market</strong></p>
<p>Average wages affect migration flows within Europe as workers seek better living conditions and higher incomes by moving to countries with higher wages. This, in turn, affects the labour market, creating additional competition and demand for skilled workers. An analysis of average salaries in Europe in 2023 highlights the significant differences between countries, reflecting levels of economic development, cost of living and national tax systems. Understanding these differences is important for employees when considering overseas employment opportunities and for employers when planning talent attraction and retention strategies. Below, lawyers and tax advisors from <strong class="golden">Regulated United Europe </strong>have prepared an overview of the size of average salaries in various European countries.</p>

			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Average wage in Europe per month</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Average wages are a key indicator of a country&#8217;s economic well-being and standard of living. In Europe, a continent with a high level of economic development and a diversity of national economies, average wages vary considerably from country to country. This indicator depends on many factors, including the economic policy of the state, inflation rate, supply and demand in the labour market, and the sectoral structure of the economy. In this article we will look at average salaries in different European countries, analysing the main trends and factors affecting the level of income.</p>
<h3>Average salary by European countries</h3>
<p>Western European countries such as Luxembourg, Switzerland and Norway have the highest average wages due to their high level of economic development, stable domestic markets and effective economic policies. Average salaries in these countries can reach 3000-4000 euros per month.</p>
<p>In Central and Eastern European countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, average salaries are lower due to historical and economic factors as well as differences in the cost of living. Here, the average income level varies between 800-1500 euros per month.</p>
<p>Mediterranean countries, including Spain, Italy and Greece, show average salaries that can range from €1,500 to €2,500 per month, depending on the region and sector.</p>
<h3>Factors affecting the salary level</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Economic policy of the state.</strong> Tax policy, state investment in the economy, labour market regulation have a significant impact on the level of wages.</li>
<li><strong>Demand and supply in the labour market.</strong> The shortage or surplus of labour in certain industries affects the level of wages.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation rate.</strong> A high inflation rate may increase nominal wages but reduce their real purchasing power.</li>
<li><strong>Sectoral structure of the economy.</strong> Countries with a developed high-tech sector, financial services and industry tend to have higher wage levels.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Prospects and trends</h3>
<p>In recent years, there has been a trend towards globalisation of the labour market and increased labour mobility within Europe. This has contributed to the equalisation of wages across countries, especially in the highly skilled sector. However, geographical and economic differences still leave a significant gap between Western and Eastern European countries.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Average wages in Europe reflect both pan-European trends in economic development and the specifics of individual countries. With globalisation and increased labour mobility, wage levels are expected to continue to level off, which will require states to take active steps to create attractive conditions for talent and investment.</p>

In these countries, the average annual adjusted wage in full-time employment is respectively 13,000 euros in Romania, 12,600 euros in Hungary, and 10,300 euros in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>The data reflect a situation where a significant proportion of the population in these countries earn at the minimum wage, emphasising the low level of income compared to other EU countries. This is also confirmed by a survey of wages across European countries, which shows hourly rates and average monthly wages in different sectors of the economy. For example, in Bulgaria the pay per hour in the private sector is only 4.70 euros, which is one of the lowest rates in Europe.</p>
<p>These data emphasise the economic differences between EU countries and point to the need for policies to improve living standards in countries with low average wages.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Agriculture, forestry and fisheries</strong>: This sector has traditionally been characterised by low wages due to the seasonality of work, high part-time employment and a large amount of informal employment. Workers in these sectors often face labour conditions that can vary depending on yields and market conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Catering and hospitality</strong>: This sector also has relatively low average salaries. This is due to the large number of low-skilled jobs, high levels of part-time and temporary work, and the strong influence of seasonal fluctuations on the labour market.</li>
<li>Retail: Retail trade includes a variety of activities, from clothing shops to food supermarkets. This sector is also dominated by relatively low wages, often due to the large number of part-time and seasonal jobs, especially in tourist areas.</li>
<li><strong>Administrative and support services</strong>: This sector includes various activities such as temporary employment agencies, cleaning services and office building maintenance. Workers in these areas often face low wages, job insecurity and uncertain working conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>These sectors are characterised by low average wages for various reasons, including high levels of informal employment, seasonality of work, low skill levels of the required labour force and high competition in the labour market. It is important to note that data on average wages may vary by country, region and specific labour market conditions.</p>

Specialists in artificial intelligence, machine learning, software development and project management in IT can expect high incomes.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Services</strong>: This sector remains one of the highest paid, especially in investment banking, asset management and insurance. High salaries are due to the complexity of the work, the high level of responsibility and the need for specialised knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Health</strong>: Doctors, especially subspecialists and highly qualified health workers in the EU, earn high salaries. The growth of salaries in this sector is supported by the increasing demand for health services, also due to the ageing population.</li>

<h3> Andorra visa requirements and application 2024</h3>
<p>In 2024, Andorra continues to attract tourists with its mountainous landscapes, winter sports and tax-free shopping. Although Andorra does not have its own airport and is not a member of the European Union or Schengen Agreement, most foreign nationals need to pass through France or Spain to enter the country, which makes the visa application process a bit tricky.</p>
<p><strong>Visa Requirements for Entry into Andorra</strong></p>
<p>As Andorra does not issue its own visas, third country nationals need to obtain a double or multiple entry Schengen visa issued by France or Spain to visit Andorra. This will allow you to cross the border and enter Andorra through one of these countries. Here are the basic steps and requirements to consider:</p>
<p>1 <strong>Determining the Type of Visa</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the purpose of your trip (tourism, business, study, etc.) you will need to determine which type of Schengen visa is most suitable for your trip.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Submission of the Application</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The application for a Schengen visa is submitted to the consulate or embassy of France or Spain, depending on which country you plan to enter Andorra through. You will need to fill in an application form and collect the necessary documents.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Required Documents</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A valid passport.</li>
<li>Completed and signed visa application form.</li>
<li>Photographs that meet the requirements for the visa.</li>
<li>Proof of accommodation booking in Andorra or in the country of entry (France/Spain).</li>
<li>Insurance covering the entire period of stay in the Schengen area.</li>
<li>Evidence of sufficient funds to cover expenses while travelling.</li>
<li>Round trip tickets or travel plans.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Visa Fee</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Payment of the visa fee, the amount of which depends on the type of visa and the age of the applicant.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Timeframes for Processing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Processing times for visa applications can vary, so it is advisable to apply early.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Tips</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Checking Current Restrictions</strong>: Given the changing COVID-19 situation, it is important to check in advance the current entry restrictions and health requirements for entry into France, Spain and Andorra.</li>
<li><strong>Road Map</strong>: As Andorra is only accessible by road, make sure you have all the necessary documents to cross the border, including a hire car if applicable.</li>

<p>Visiting Andorra requires careful planning, especially when it comes to visa and border formalities. Despite not having its own visa system, compliance with Schengen visa requirements and prior preparation will ensure a smooth entry and a pleasant stay in this principality.<br />

			<p>Taxation of dividends in European countries is an important aspect of the financial system that affects both investors and corporations. Each country in Europe has its own peculiarities in tax legislation, which are reflected in different rates and rules for taxing dividends. In the largest EU countries, dividends are taxed at the following rates:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Germany</strong>: In Germany, dividends are taxed at a rate of about 26.375%, including a 25% capital income tax and a 5.5% solidarity tax on capital income. This means that investors who receive dividends from German companies pay a significant portion of these revenues in the form of taxes.</li>
<li><strong>France</strong>: In France, the tax rate on dividends is 30%. This rate includes 12.8% income tax and 17.2% social contributions. For non-residents, the tax rate may be reduced in accordance with bilateral tax agreements.</li>
<li><strong>Italy</strong>: In Italy, dividends are taxed at a rate of 26%. This is a relatively high rate compared to some other European countries, reflecting the government&#8217;s desire to balance the tax burden between different types of income.</li>
<li><strong>United Kingdom</strong>: After Brexit, the UK has a distinctive tax system from the EU. Tax rates on dividends vary from 7.5% to 38.1%, depending on the recipient&#8217;s tax category.</li>
<li><strong>Spain</strong>: In Spain, the tax on dividends is 19% for incomes up to 6,000 euros, 21% for incomes between 6,000 and 50,000 euros, and 23% for incomes over 50,000 euros.</li>
<li><strong>Netherlands</strong>: In the Netherlands, the tax rate on dividends is 15%. This is a relatively low rate, which makes the Netherlands an attractive investment destination.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each country applies different approaches to taxation of dividends, based on its own economic policies and international agreements. Tax rates may change depending on current economic conditions and political decisions. It should also be noted that many European countries have concluded bilateral tax agreements to avoid double taxation, which can significantly reduce the tax burden on investors.

			<h3>Dividend tax in Estonia 2024</h3>

A special feature of this system is an unusual approach to taxation of corporate profits and dividends.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Principles</strong></p>
<p>In Estonia, corporate income tax is not levied until the time of profit distribution. This means that profits reinvested in business development are tax-free. Income tax is charged only when profits are distributed in the form of dividends, bonuses, gifts, or other distributions.</p>
<p><strong>Tax Rate</strong></p>
<p>The corporate tax rate in Estonia is 20% of the distributed profit. This rate is applied to the amount of dividends before they are paid, which means the actual tax rate for the recipient is 20/80 (or 25%) of the dividends received.</p>
<p><strong>Special features for Non-residents</strong></p>
<p>Special rules may apply to non-residents who receive dividends from Estonian companies, depending on bilateral tax agreements between Estonia and the recipient&#8217;s country of residence. In some cases, this may result in a lower tax rate or a tax exemption.</p>
<p><strong>Tax Benefits</strong></p>
<p>Estonia offers certain benefits for certain categories of dividends. For example, dividends paid out of profits that have already been taxed may be exempt from additional taxation.</p>
<p><strong> E-Residency System</strong></p>
<p>The unique e-Residency program in Estonia allows entrepreneurs from all over the world to register and manage an Estonian company online, which also affects the payment of taxes and distribution of dividends.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Taxation of dividends in Estonia is characterized by its simplicity and efficiency, helping to attract foreign investment and support entrepreneurship. The unique system of profit taxation, where the tax is paid only on the distribution of profits, makes Estonia attractive for business and investment. This highlights the country&#8217;s reputation as one of the most innovative and business-oriented markets in Europe.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft " title="Dividend tax in Germany " src="https://regulatedunitedeurope.com/wp-content/uploads/Flag_of_Germany.svg" alt="Dividend tax in Germany " width="100" />Taxation of dividends in Germany is characterized by its own peculiarities, which reflect the complex system of tax legislation of the country. Understanding these features is critical in order to ensure the tax efficiency of investments.</p>
<p><strong>About New Dividend Taxation in Germany</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tax rates</strong>: In Germany, the tax on dividends for individuals is 25% plus a solidary tax of 5.5% of the tax on capital income. This means, that the total tax rate on dividends is approximately 26.375%.</li>
<li><strong>Tax credit</strong>: Germany applies a tax credit system to avoid double taxation of dividends.</li>
<li><strong>Taxation for non-residents</strong>: For non-residents who receive dividends from German companies, the standard tax rate on dividends is 25% plus solidarity tax. However, the rate may be reduced in accordance with bilateral tax agreements.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Features for Corporate Investors</strong></p>
<p>Corporate investors in Germany pay tax on dividends at a special rate. Corporations that own a significant stake in another company may be exempt from tax on dividends or pay a reduced rate.</p>
<p><strong>Double Taxation</strong></p>
<p>Germany has many bilateral tax agreements that prevent double taxation. This means that dividends paid by German companies to foreign investors can be taxed at a lower rate, depending on the agreement between Germany and the investor&#8217;s country.</p>
<p><strong>Tax Benefits and Exemptions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Small business benefits</strong>: Small businesses in Germany can enjoy certain tax benefits that can reduce the tax burden on dividends.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate exemption</strong>: Corporations that own a significant stake in another corporation may be partially or completely exempt from paying taxes on dividends.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tax Planning and Compliance with Legislation</strong></p>
<p>Effective tax planning and strict compliance with tax laws are critical for companies and individual investors in Germany. This requires a deep understanding of local tax rules and regulations. Taxation of dividends in Germany is a complex but important area to understand for both local and international investors and for international investors. It requires attention to detail and an understanding of current tax legislation and bilateral tax agreements.</p>
<p>German dividend tax is a tax on income from invested capital (Abgeltungssteuer). Interest on deposits, shares, and bonds is taxable as investment income. This tax is equal to income tax and is indicated in the tax return, along with other taxes paid.</p>
<p>The Bank withholds tax on dividends from individuals automatically. And legal entities pay for it when distributing profits in the companies GmbH or AG, in which they own a share of capital.</p>
<p><strong>Tax rate at the source of payment</strong></p>
<p>The tax on dividends and shares in Germany does not depend on the amount of total income, and the same fixed rate applies to all of them. The investor pays a flat rate of 25% on all income from dividends, interest and investment funds.</p>
<p>You must also pay a Solidari tatszuschlag supplement of 5.5% of the dividend tax. The solidarity allowance was introduced after the unification of Germany to support the economy of the eastern states of Germany. In addition, if the payer is a member of the church, the church tax is also charged, which is 8-9% depending on the federal land.</p>
<p>Total tax burden: withholding tax rate of 25% +solidarity surcharge (5.5 x 0.25)% = 26.375%. And taking into account the church tax, it can reach up to 28.6%.</p>
<p>Tax residents of Germany do not pay capital gains tax if the income from investments does not exceed the non-taxable amount-801 euros per year per person or 1 1,602 euros per year for married couples. In order to request a tax benefit, you need to write an application to the bank (Freistellungsauftrag).</p>
<p>If dividends are distributed to a foreign tax resident, other rules may apply. They often depend on the status of the recipient of the dividend-an individual or a company, and on the country of their tax residence.</p>
<p>Rules that apply to companies that receive dividends:</p>
<p><strong>The first case </strong>is if there is no double taxation agreement between the two countries and the recipient of the dividend is not from an EU country. If a German company pays dividends to a foreign parent company, it is taxed at a rate of 26.375% (including the solidarity contribution). However, if a non-resident transfers profits to a local firm in Germany, compensation is possible for the source. Then the tax rate will be reduced to15.825%. The benefit is available for companies that are not covered by the agreement on the avoidance of double taxation.</p>
<p><strong>The second case </strong>is if there is a double taxation agreement between the two countries. Then the maximum retained rate is indicated in the agreement. Thus, the tax on dividends received by a Russian company from a German subsidiary can be reduced to 5%. To do this, a Russian company must own at least 10% of the authorized capital of a German company paying dividends, and the amount of this share in the capital must be at least 80,000 euros. In all other cases, the tax rate on dividends will be 15%.</p>
<p>In the third case, if the dividends are paid to a company from the European Union that has owned at 2 least 10% of the capital of a German company for 2 years, no withholding tax is charged. At the same time, both companies must be subject to corporate tax and be in the legal form specified in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/GA/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32011L0096" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the directive.</a> Of the Council of the European Union on taxation of parent companies and subsidiaries of Member States of 30 November 2011.</p>
<p>For individuals who are recipients of dividends, the tax is determined under the agreement for the avoidance of double taxation, if there is no such agreement, then 26.375%.</p>
<p>When paying royalties abroad in Germany, withholding tax is charged at a rate of 15%, and taking into account all allowances-15.8%. The rate of this tax may be reduced by an international tax agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Real estate dividend tax</strong></p>
<p>Real estate in Germany is subject to dividend tax if the property is registered to a legal entity. The dividend tax is levied after income tax is paid, when the capital is transferred to the owner of the company. Note that the property owner does not always distribute dividends to himself, for example, he can reinvest the profit.</p>
